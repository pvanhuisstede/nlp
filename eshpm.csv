We argue that their review provides political scientists and healthcare scholars with a firm basis to further explore the relationships between populism and welfare policies in different political systems. In line with the authors, we furthermore (re)emphasize the need for additional empirical inquiries into the relationship between populism and healthcare. But instead of expanding the research agenda suggested - for instance by adding categories or niches in which this relationship can be observed - we would like to challenge some of the premises of the studies conducted and reviewed thus far. We do so by identifying two concerns and by illustrating these concerns with two examples from the Netherlands.",Welfare States,Health Care Sciences & Services

Its centrality is particularly evident in the choice modeling literature, notably in its widespread application to environmental and health economics, marketing, and transport. Despite conceptual and empirical advances in modeling preference heterogeneity, the generalizability of preference heterogeneity to different decision contexts and different data generation processes remains an open question. The basic premise of this paper is that latent sources of preference heterogeneity can be decomposed into components general to decision contexts and others specific to them. We study the structure of preference heterogeneity in different data generation processes with the goal of reliably identifying common (presumably generalizable) and specific (presumably not generalizable) sources of preference heterogeneity. The contribution of the paper is both conceptual and methodological, leading to the testing of five rival model specifications which together elucidate the heterogeneity structure present in two preference data sources of the same choice behavior. In the empirical application, we find that the multitrait-multimethod model of preference heterogeneity has the best fit and most sensible interpretations, indicating that while each data source contributes uniquely to certain heterogeneity components, both data sources contribute also to common (generalizable) preference heterogeneity. Recognition of the separability of the common versus source-specific preference heterogeneity will lead to more reliable and accurate demand model forecasts and assessments of welfare impacts.",Stated preferences,Business & Economics

We explore the relevance of relative comparisons by testing the effect of people's self-rated position on potential reference points for income and health on their subjective well-being. We used Multiple Discrepancies Theory as a framework to identify seven potentially relevant reference points for income and health. A representative sample (N = 550) of the Netherlands assessed their income and health relative to these reference points. In addition, we elicited monthly household income, health status (EQ-5D-5L), and subjective well-being (SWLS). In line with the literature, we found a negative convex relationship between subjective well-being and age and a positive relationship with being employed, income, and health. For income, subjective well-being was also associated with how current income compared to respondents' needs and progression over time, and for health especially with how current health compared to what they felt they deserved. Our findings suggest that income and health are important for subjective well-being both in absolute and relative terms. We found negative effects on life satisfaction if some of the domain specific reference points were not met.",subjective well-being,Health Care Sciences & Services

For the purpose of revalidation, or maintenance of certification, they need to demonstrate that they have engaged with the outcomes of these appraisals. The combination of taking ownership in professional development and meeting accountability requirements may cause undesirable interference of purposes. To support physicians in their professional development, new Dutch legislation requires that they discuss their performance data with a non-hierarchical (peer)coach and draft a personal development plan. In this study, we report on the design of this system for performance appraisal in a Dutch academic medical center. Methods Using a design-based research approach, a hospital-based research group had the lead in drafting and implementing a performance appraisal protocol, selecting a multisource feedback tool, co-developing and piloting a coaching approach, implementing a planning tool, recruiting peer coaches and facilitating their training and peer group debriefings. Results The system consisted of a two-hour peer-to-peer conversation based on the principles of appreciative inquiry and solution-focused coaching. Sessions were rated as highly motivating, development-oriented, concrete and valuable. Peer coaches were considered suitable, although occasionally physicians preferred a professional coach because of their expertise. The system honored both accountability and professional development purposes. By integrating the performance appraisal system with an already existing internal performance system, physicians were enabled to openly and safely discuss their professional development with a peer, while also being supported by their superior in their self-defined developmental goals. Although the peer-to-peer conversation was mandatory and participation in the process was documented, it was up to the physician whether or not to share its results with others, including their superior. Conclusions In the context of mandatory revalidation, professional development can be supported when the appraisal process involves three characteristics: the appraisal process is appreciative and explores developmental opportunities; coaches are trustworthy and skilled; and the physician has control over the disclosure of the appraisal output. Although the peer-to-peer conversations were positively evaluated, the effects on physicians' professional development have yet to be investigated in longitudinal research designs.",Design-based research (DBR),Health Care Sciences & Services

Nevertheless, relations between healthcare organisations and their financial stakeholders have not been well studied. Here, we studied the relations between Dutch healthcare organisations and two of their main financial stakeholders (banks and health insurers) against the backdrop of system reforms and the financial crisis. We conducted a survey of healthcare executives to evaluate their relations with banks and health insurers in terms of power, legitimacy and urgency. These three attributes are based on the salience model of Mitchel, Agle and Wood (1997). We further tested for differences in power, legitimacy and urgency across organisational sector and size. The results showed that healthcare organisations value banks as legitimate stakeholders with a well-demarcated influence and a clear-cut function. The relationship with health insurers is more complex. Healthcare organisations experience considerable influence from health insurers but question the legitimacy of their claims. Since health insurers play a crucial role in the Dutch healthcare system, these findings question the workability of the relationship between healthcare organisations and health insurers and the position of health insurers in the overall healthcare sector. Our results are relevant to countries with public-private health systems and contribute to the development of the salience model by showing the individual value of stakeholder attributes and the relevance of context.

Study design: A decision analytic model was used to estimate the costs and outcomes for patients screened using the SOC and for those using the FMF screening algorithm, from the Belgian payers' perspective. Where possible, the probabilities and associated costs at each decision point were calculated based on published literature and public databases. Main outcome measures: Cost-effectiveness was assessed using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of independent variations in each model parameter. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to estimate the impact of the overall uncertainty of the model on the estimated cost-effectiveness. Results: Considering an estimated 51,309 pregnancies in nulliparous women in Belgium per year, the FMF screening algorithm resulted in fewer cases of pre-term PE compared with the SOC (479 versus 816 cases) and a cost saving of euro 28.67 per patient. The outcome in quality-adjusted life-years was similar for both screening approaches (FMF screening algorithm 1.8521 versus SOC 1.8518). The FMF screening algorithm was cost-saving and more effective in 99.4% of simulations. Conclusions: The FMF screening algorithm coupled with early intervention using low-dose aspirin has the potential to prevent an additional 337 cases of pre-term PE per year compared with the current SOC in this population, along with a cost saving.",Standard of care,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology

This paper focuses on the distributional consequences across socio-economic groups of including these costs in cost effectiveness analysis. In that context, it also highlights the role of remaining quality of life and household economies of scale. Data from a Dutch household spending survey was used to estimate non-medical consumption and household size by age and educational attainment. Estimates of non-medical consumption and household size were combined with life tables to estimate what the impact of including non-medical survivor costs would be on the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of preventing a death at a certain age. Results show that including non-medical survivor costs increases estimated ICERs most strongly when interventions are targeted at the higher educated. Adjusting for household size (lower educated people less often live additional life years in multi-person households) and quality of life (lower educated people on average spend added life years in poorer health) mitigates this difference. Ignoring costs of non-medical consumption in economic evaluations implicitly favors interventions targeted at the higher educated and thus potentially amplifies socio-economic inequalities in health.",inequalities in health,Health Care Sciences & Services

The neglect of a focus on empowerment and the presence of implementation barriers have been put forward as possible explanations for this. This study aimed to gain insight into how to co-create and develop an empowerment theory-based health education intervention for urological cancer patients. Design: Bravo's empowerment intervention model provided the theoretical foundations for the work undertaken with urological cancer patients in the Netherlands, using a participatory interactive learning and action approach. Method: Insights into needs regarding health education were obtained through semi-structured interviews with patients (n = 22) and health professionals (n = 17). Subsequently, eight co-creation sessions (n = 30) were organised to translate these needs into a health education intervention. Results: An intervention in the form of digital patient information was developed. The information offered provides a view of the different care steps based on clinical guidelines but personalised in different ways. By connecting patients' empowerment needs to the information provided, and by taking health professionals' perspectives into account, barriers to health education were made visible and addressed. Conclusion: Patient empowerment theory proved valuable in better aligning a participatory research process with the empowerment needs of urological cancer patients. The programme theory developed may offer a valuable template for the development of future health education interventions.",urological cancer,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

This project served as a case study in which we applied boundary-work theory as a framework to understand boundaries (ie demarcations) between and within groups, and how these boundaries can be overcome. Objective To gain insights into the boundaries encountered when setting a research agenda, we analysed how this agenda served as a boundary object (ie circumstances, situations or material that connect actor groups and allow boundary crossing) that facilitated crossing boundaries and uniting the perspectives of patients and practitioners. Methods We used a thematic approach to analyse researchers' observations, meeting materials, emails, interviews with patients (n = 11) and a survey among patients and practitioners (n = 18). Results Setting the research agenda helped to cross boundaries in oral health care, which demonstrates its role as a boundary object. First, this made it possible to integrate research topics representing the perspectives and priorities of all patients and also to unite those perspectives. It was essential to involve practitioners at an early stage of the project so that they could better accept the patients' perspectives. This resulted in support for an integrated research agenda, which facilitated the crossing of boundaries. Conclusions The research agenda-setting project was found to serve as a boundary object in uniting the perspectives and priorities of patients and practitioners.

However, care practices involve a plurality of possibly conflicting values. These values often transgress the borders of the individual professional-client relationship as they involve family members, other professionals and community organisations. Good care should acknowledge this relational complexity, which requires a collective handling of the tensions between values. To better understand this process, we draw on [Mol, A. 2008.

An ethnographic study was conducted in two teams in community housing services for people with Intellectual Disabilities and Severe Mental Illness. Collective tinkering is analysed (1) within teams; (2) between professionals, family members and professionals from different organisations providing care for the same client; and (3) in organising practices for a collective of clients. Collective tinkering involves assembling goods into a care practice, attentively experimenting with these care practices, and adjusting care accordingly within a collective of those involved in care for a particular client (group). When collective tinkering does not occur, the stakeholders excluded (e.g. clients or family members) may experience poor quality of care.",autonomy,Social Work

This could entail installing an integrated, international early warning system, aiming to contain and mitigate infectious diseases outbreaks. The amount of resources governments should spend on such preventive measures can be informed by the value citizens attach to such a system. This was already recognized in 2018, when a contingent valuation willingness to pay (WTP) experiment was fielded, eliciting the WTP for such a system in six European countries. We replicated that experiment in the spring of 2020 to test whether and how WTP had changed during an actual pandemic (COVID-19), taking into account differences in infection rates and stringency of measures by government between countries. Overall, we found significant increases in WTP between the two time points, with mean WTP for an early warning system increasing by about 50% (median 30%), from around euro20 to euro30 per month. However, there were marked differences between countries and subpopulations, and changes were only partially explained by COVID-19 burden.

While some changes might persist (e.g. substitution of specialist visits by online consultations), others will be transitory (e.g. fewer surgical procedures due to cancellation of treatments). This paper discusses the implications of transitory changes in healthcare utilization and spending for risk adjustment of health plan payment. In practice, risk adjustment methodologies typically consist of two steps: (1) calibration of payment weights for a given set of risk adjusters and (2) calculation of payments to insurers by combining the calibrated weights with enrollee characteristics. In this paper, we first introduce a simple conceptual framework for analyzing the (potential) distortions from the pandemic for both steps and then provide a hypothetical illustration of how these distortions can lead to under- or overpayment of insurers. The size of these under-/overpayments depends on (1) the impact of the pandemic on patterns in utilization and spending, (2) the distribution of risk types across insurers, (3) the extent to which insurers are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, and (4) features of the risk adjustment system.",COVID-19,Health Care Sciences & Services

Consequently, many hospitals seek to alleviate regulatory pressures by seeking an alternative quality management system (QMS). This paper takes the Netherlands as a case. To investigate how QMSs for IITs are organized in Dutch hospitals, we adopted the theoretical concepts of mentoring and monitoring in a mixed methods study in the period 2014-2018. In clinical practice and international guidelines, monitoring is seen as the standard quality assurance for ongoing trials. However, hospitals have implemented monitoring programs that resemble mentoring. The contrast between these ideal types is less pronounced in practice as both combine elements of compliance and feedback for learning in practice. In a monitoring setting, learning is one-way, from monitor to researcher; whereas mentoring focuses on mutual support and learning. To tackle problems in each system, the authority of the Board of Directors (BoD) and the BoD's relationship with staff members are crucial. We discuss the challenges that BoD and staff face in keeping an integrated view of the various components of QMSs.",Data management,Medical Ethics

Methods The MHQoL dimensions were based on prior research by Connell and colleagues, highlighting the seven most important quality of life dimensions in the context of mental health. Items were generated following a systematic review we performed and through inviting expert opinion. A focus group and an online qualitative study (N = 120) were carried out to assess the face and content validity of the MHQoL. The MHQoL was further tested for its internal consistency, convergent validity, known-group validity and test-retest reliability among mental healthcare service users (N = 479) and members of the general population (N = 110). Results The MHQoL consists of a descriptive system (MHQoL-7D), including s items covering seven dimensions (self-image, independence, mood, relationships, daily activities, physical health, future) and a visual analogue scale of general psychological well-being (MHQoL-VAS). Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's proportional to = 0.85) and correlations between MHQoL-7D scores and related measures (EQ-5D-5L, MANSA, ICECAP-A, and BSI) supported convergent validity. The intraclass correlation coefficient of the MHQoL-7D sum score for test-retest reliability was 0.85. Known-group validity was supported by the ability to detect significant differences in MHQoL-7D levels between service users and the general population, and between groups with different levels of psychological distress. Conclusion The MHQoL demonstrated favourable psychometric properties and showed promise as a simple and effective measure to assess quality of life in people with mental health problems.",Psychometric evaluation,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Interest in VBHC has grown significantly in developed countries that seek to preserve the sustainability of their healthcare systems. Consequently, it is likely that VBHC will soon play a meaningful role in health economic policy and decision making. Because VBHC and CEA share many similarities, academics have pointed out that integration could lead to opportunities for improvements in both fields. Methods: An exploration of overlapping topics in VBHC and CEA literature was performed to establish initial links between them. A new methodologic approach is described to consolidate key value frameworks from the respective fields. Results: Several key themes emerged in which these 2 concepts can reinforce each other: interpretation of value, sensitivity to outcome changes, scientific credibility, methodology and measurement, and usability in decision making. Subsequently, an initial method is described of how the VBHC framework for value could be integrated into CEA through a so-called valuebased healthcare quality-adjusted life year (VBHC-QALY). Conclusion: This article introduces the existing VBHC value framework to the cornerstone of modern CEA and substantiates the presumption of health economists that valuable synergies arise from consolidating the individual strengths of CEA and VBHC. Through integration CEA can help establish robust methods for VBHC implementation, while the latter can complement the former with a new viewpoint and conceptual toolbox for patient centricity and the definition of value.",patient centricity,Health Care Sciences & Services

We use three nationally representative datasets to examine trends in income- and race-related inequalities in life expectancy (LE) and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) since the beginning of the millennium. We find that, in aggregate, (HA)LE at age five fell substantially between 2001 and 2007, but then increased to above 2001 levels by 2016, with the largest changes observed among prime age adults. Income- and race-related inequalities in both LE and HALE favor relatively well-off and non-Black South Africans in all survey years. Both income- and race-related inequalities in (HA)LE grew between 2001 and 2007, and then narrowed between 2007 to 2016. However, while race-related inequalities in (HA)LE in 2016 were smaller than in 2001, income-related inequalities in (HA)LE were greater in 2016 than in 2001. Based on the patterns and timing observed, these trends in income- and race-related inequalities in (HA)LE are most likely related to the delayed initial policy response to the HIV epidemic, the subsequent rapid and effective rollout of anti-retroviral therapy, and the changes in the overall income distribution among Black South Africans. In particular, the growth of the Black middle class narrowed the HA(LE) gap with the non-Black population but reinforced income-related inequalities.",South Africa,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

However, practical applications of MCDA are sparse. One potential use for MCDA is for the evaluation of programs for complex and vulnerable patients. These complex patients benefit from integrated care programs that span healthcare and social care and aim to improve more than just health outcomes. MCDA can evaluate programs that aim to improve broader outcomes because it allows the evaluation of multiple outcomes alongside each other. In this study, we evaluate an innovative integrated care program in the Netherlands using MCDA. Methods: We used an innovative MCDA framework with broad outcomes of health, well-being, and cost to evaluate the Better Together in Amsterdam North (BSiN) program using preferences of patients, partners, providers, payers, and policy makers in the Netherlands. BSiN provides case management support for a period of 6 months. Seven outcomes that previous research has deemed important to complex patients were measured, including physical functioning and social relationships and participation. Results: We find that the program improved the overall MCDA score marginally, and, thus, after 6 and after 12 months, BSiN was preferred to usual care by all stakeholders. BSiN was preferred to usual care, mostly owing to improvements in psychological well-being and social relationships and participation. Conclusions: The integrated healthcare and social care program BSiN in the Netherlands was preferred to usual care according to an MCDA evaluation. MCDA seems a useful method to evaluate complex programs with benefits beyond health.",well-being,Health Care Sciences & Services

Especially when lives of people with underlying health conditions are extended, the impact of future medical costs is large. This inclusion may make vaccination a less attractive option, especially in relation to low thresholds as often applied for prevention. Although this raises important questions, ignoring these real future costs may lead to an inefficient use of healthcare resources. Our results may imply that prices for some vaccines need to be lowered to be cost-effective. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

It argues that the incentive to return can be found in the difficulties that veterans have in assigning positive meaning to their deployment because existing collective and cultural memories about the war and the genocide in Srebrenica do not align with many of the veterans' experiences during and after the war. In the analysis of interviews conducted with seventeen Dutch veterans, attention is paid to their wartime memories, motivation to return, and experiences during the return trips. Returning to former places of deployment provides a way to reconcile memories, especially traumatic ones. The building of these memories passes through several phases: introspection; opening up to family, friends, and relatives; and helping others.",and Bosnia-Herzegovina,Psychology

Policy attempts to implement new competency frameworks and job profiles often fails for not serving existing nursing practices. This study is aimed to understand how licensed vocational nurses (VNs) and nurses with a Bachelor of Science degree (BNs) shape distinct nursing roles in daily practice. Methods A qualitative study was conducted in four wards (neurology, oncology, pneumatology and surgery) of a Dutch teaching hospital. Various ethnographic methods were used: shadowing nurses in daily practice (65h), observations and participation in relevant meetings (n=56), informal conversations (up to 15 h), 22 semi-structured interviews and member-checking with four focus groups (19 nurses in total). Data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Hospital nurses developed new role distinctions in a series of small-change experiments, based on action and appraisal. Our findings show that: (1) this developmental approach incorporated the nurses' invisible work; (2) nurses' roles evolved through the accumulation of small changes that included embedding the new routines in organizational structures; (3) the experimental approach supported the professionalization of nurses, enabling them to translate national legislation into hospital policies and supporting the nurses' (bottom-up) evolution of practices. The new roles required the special knowledge and skills of Bachelor-trained nurses to support healthcare quality improvement and connect the patients' needs to organizational capacity. Conclusions Conducting small-change experiments, anchored by action and appraisal rather than by design, clarified the distinctions between vocational and Bachelor-trained nurses. The process stimulated personal leadership and boosted the responsibility nurses feel for their own development and the nursing profession in general. This study indicates that experimental nursing role development provides opportunities for nursing professionalization and gives nurses, managers and policymakers the opportunity of a 'two-way-window' in nursing role development, aligning policy initiatives with daily nursing practices.",Qualitative study,Nursing

However, undergoing any systematic comparative analysis of the trends can be challenging given the quantity of data that must be presented. Methods We use the GBD data to describe trends in cause-specific DALY rates for eight regions. We quantify the extent to which the importance of 'major' DALY causes changes relative to 'minor' DALY causes over time by decomposing changes in the Gini coefficient into 'proportionality' and 'reranking' indices. Results The fall in regional DALY rates since 1990 has been accompanied by generally positive proportionality indices and reranking indices of negligible magnitude. However, the rate at which DALY rates have been falling has slowed and, at the same time, proportionality indices have tended towards zero. These findings are clearest where the focus is exclusively upon non-communicable diseases. Notably, large and positive proportionality indices are recorded for sub-Saharan Africa over the last decade. Conclusion The positive proportionality indices show that disease burden has become less concentrated around the leading causes over time, and this trend has become less prominent as the DALY rate decline has slowed. The recent decline in disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionally driven by improvements in DALY rates for HIV/AIDS, as well as for malaria, diarrheal diseases, and lower respiratory infections.",Gini,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Exploring enrollees' ability and willingness to pay,"Indonesia faces a growing informal sector in the wake of implementing a national social health insurance system-Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN)-that supersedes the vertical programmes historically tied to informal employment. Sustainably financing coverage for informal workers requires incentivising enrolment for those never insured and recovering enrolment among those who once paid but no longer do so. This study aims to assess the ability- and willingness-to-pay of informal sector workers who have stopped paying the JKN premium for at least six months, across districts of different fiscal capacity, and explore which factors shaped their willingness and ability to pay using qualitative interviews. Surveys were conducted for 1,709 respondents in 2016, and found that informal workers' average ability and willingness to pay fell below the national health insurance scheme's premium amount, even as many currently spend more than this on healthcare costs. There were large groups for whom the costs of the premium were prohibitive (38%) or, alternatively, they were both technically willing and able to pay (25%). As all individuals in the sample had once paid for insurance, their main reasons for lapsing were based on the uncertain income of informal workers and their changing needs. The study recommends a combination of strategies of targeting of subsidies, progressive premium setting, facilitating payment collection, incentivising insurance package upgrades and socialising the benefits of health insurance in informal worker communities.",,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Standard molecular diagnostics are currently very heterogeneous, and tests are often performed sequentially. The alternative to whole genome sequencing (WGS) i.e. simultaneously testing for all relevant DNA-based biomarkers thereby allowing immediate selection of the most optimal therapy, is more costly than current techniques. In the current implementation stage, it is important to explore the added value and cost-effectiveness of using WGS on a patient level and to assess optimal introduction of WGS on the level of the healthcare system. Areas covered: First, an overview of current worldwide initiatives concerning the use of WGS in clinical practice for cancer diagnostics is given. Second, a comprehensive, early health technology assessment (HTA) approach of evaluating WGS in the Netherlands is described, relating to the following aspects: diagnostic value, WGS-based treatment decisions, assessment of long-term health benefits and harms, early cost-effectiveness modeling, nation-wide organization, and Ethical, Legal and Societal Implications.

To make primary care for these patients more patient centered, insight on healthcare professionals' perceived PCC implementation barriers is needed. In this study, healthcare professionals' perceived barriers to primary PCC delivery to patients with multimorbidity were investigated using a constructivist qualitative design based on semi-structured interviews with nine general and nurse practitioners from seven general practices in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used, and the interview content was analyzed to generate themes representing experienced barriers. Barriers were identified in all eight PCC dimensions (patient preferences, information and education, access to care, physical comfort, emotional support, family and friends, continuity and transition, and coordination of care). They include difficulties achieving mutual understanding between patients and healthcare professionals, professionals' lack of training and education in new skills, data protection laws that impede adequate documentation and information sharing, time pressure, and conflicting financial incentives. These barriers pose true challenges to effective, sustainable PCC implementation at the patient, organizational, and national levels. Further improvement of primary care delivery to patients with multimorbidity is needed to overcome these barriers.",qualitative study,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

For various such diseases, the deployment of mobile screening teams forms an important instrument to reduce prevalence toward elimination targets. There is considerable variety in planning methods for the deployment of these mobile teams in practice, but little understanding of their effectiveness. Moreover, there appears to be little understanding of the relationship between the number of mobile teams and progress toward the goals. This research considers capacity planning and deployment of mobile screening teams for one such neglected tropical disease: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, or sleeping sickness). We prove that the deployment problem is strongly NP-Hard and propose three approaches to find (near) optimal screening plans. For the purpose of practical implementation in remote rural areas, we also develop four simple policies. The performance of these methods and their robustness is benchmarked for a HAT region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Two of the four simple practical policies yield near optimal solutions, one of which also appears robust against parameter impreciseness. We also present a simple approximation of prevalence as a function of screening capacity, which appears rather accurate for the case study. While the results may serve to more effectively allocate funding and deploy mobile screening capacity, they also indicate that mobile screening may not suffice to achieve HAT elimination.",human African trypanosomiasis,Operations Research & Management Science

The specific behavioral mechanism whereby institutional distrust (ID) shows itself is through the activation of screening of choice options (choice set formation). However, ID-induced choice set formation might be confounded with the consumer budget constraint, especially in a developing country context, leading to biased welfare estimates for service improvement. We formulate a semi-compensatory hybrid choice set formation (SC-HCSF) model that enables us to 1) discriminate the effect of a budget constraint from that of ID-induced choice set formation and 2) characterize their separate impacts on welfare estimates using a spatial framework. We compare our model results to those from a standard Random Parameters Logit (RPL) Model. The RPL underestimates (overestimates) welfare when individuals have a low (high) ID. Based on our empirical model results, we demonstrate that the impacts of ignoring institutional trust issues can be highly deleterious to project appraisals, particularly in settings where legislative and regulatory institutions are perceived to be endemically corrupt.",Income,Business & Economics

Patients were stratified according to their stage at diagnosis and recurrence status. Costs were calculated by applying unit costs to individual patient resource use and reported for the full disease course, the initial treatment episode, and treatment episodes for disease recurrence (stratified by type of recurrence). We included 198 patients with localized melanoma and 98 patients with regionally advanced melanoma. Total costs were much higher for patients with disease recurrence than for patients without disease recurrence: euro20 007 versus euro3032 for patients with localized melanoma and euro19 519 versus euro5951 for patients with regionally advanced melanoma. This was owing to the costs of disease recurrence because the costs of the initial treatment were comparable between patients with and without disease recurrence. Costs of disease recurrence were dependent on the type of recurrence: euro4414, euro4604, euro8129 and euro10 393 for a local recurrence, intralymphatic metastases, regional lymph node metastases and distant metastases, respectively. In conclusion, healthcare costs of patients with localized and regionally advanced melanoma were rather low for the initial treatment. Costs became, however, more substantial in case of disease recurrence.

To effectively supplement nationwide policies with targeted interventions, it is important to know how these risk factors are distributed across socioeconomic segments of populations in LMICs. This study quantifies the prevalence and socioeconomic inequalities in lifestyle risk factors in LMICs, to identify policy priorities conducive to the Sustainable Development Goal of a one third reduction in deaths from NCDs by 2030.MethodsData from 1,278,624 adult respondents to Demographic & Health Surveys across 22 LMICs between 2013 and 2018 are used to estimate crude prevalence rates and socioeconomic inequalities in tobacco use, overweight, harmful alcohol use and the clustering of these three in a household. Inequalities are measured by a concentration index and correlated with the percentage of GDP spent on health. We estimate a multilevel model to examine associations of individual characteristics with the different lifestyle risk factors.ResultsThe prevalence of tobacco use among men ranges from 59.6% (Armenia) to 6.6% (Nigeria). The highest level of overweight among women is 83.7% (Egypt) while this is less than 12% in Burundi, Chad and Timor-Leste. 82.5% of women in Burundi report that their partner is ""often or sometimes drunk"" compared to 1.3% in Gambia. Tobacco use is concentrated among the poor, except for the low share of men smoking in Nigeria. Overweight, however, is concentrated among the better off, especially in Tanzania and Zimbabwe (Erreygers Index (EI) 0.227 and 0.232). Harmful alcohol use is more concentrated among the better off in Nigeria (EI 0.127), while Chad, Rwanda and Togo show an unequal pro-poor distribution (EI respectively -0.147, -0.210, -0.266). Cambodia exhibits the largest socioeconomic inequality in unhealthy household behaviour (EI -0.253). The multilevel analyses confirm that in LMICs, tobacco and alcohol use are largely concentrated among the poor, while overweight is concentrated among the better-off. The associations between the share of GDP spent on health and the socioeconomical distribution of lifestyle factors are multidirectional.ConclusionsThis study emphasizes the importance of lifestyle risk factors in LMICs and the socioeconomic variation therein.

Little primary research has been conducted into which strategies for collaboration and service provision are most effective, efficient, scalable and sustainable. Seeking to align research with urgent needs, enhance coordination and increase the likelihood that results are used, this study aimed to set an inclusive global research agenda that reflects priority research questions from key stakeholders at the intersection of HIV healthcare and faith. Methods In order to develop this global research agenda, we drew from document analyses, focus group discussions, interviews with purposively selected key informants from all continents (policy-makers, healthcare providers, faith leaders, academics and HIV activists), an online questionnaire, and expert meetings at several global conferences. We carried out focus group discussions and interviews with faith leaders in South Africa. Other stakeholder focus groups and interviews were carried out online or in person in France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and South Africa, and virtual questionnaires were distributed to stakeholders worldwide. Respondents were purposively sampled. Results We interviewed 53 participants, and 110 stakeholders responded to the online questionnaire. The participants worked in 54 countries, with the majority having research experience (84%), experience with policy processes (73%) and/or experience as a healthcare provider (60%) and identifying as religious (79%). From interviews (N = 53) and questionnaires (N = 110), we identified 10 research themes: addressing sexuality, stigma, supporting specific populations, counselling and disclosure, agenda-setting, mobilizing and organizing funding, evaluating faith-health collaborations, advantage of faith initiatives, gender roles, and education. Respondents emphasized the need for more primary research and prioritized two themes: improving the engagement of faith communities in addressing sexuality and tackling stigma. Conclusions A wide range of respondents participated in developing the research agenda.

Furthermore, socio-demographic predictors for smoking and illicit drug use in the sample population will be studied. The relationship between illicit drug use and specific characteristics of intoxication, such as blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and duration of reduced consciousness is also investigated.MethodsThe national Dutch Paediatric Surveillance Unit was used to prospectively register cases of acute alcohol intoxication from 2007 through 2017. Cases were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: BAC>0.0g/L, aged between 10 to 18years old and requiring hospital treatment due to reduced consciousness. Questionnaires were sent to paediatricians to obtain clinical information.ResultsDuring the period 2007-2017, 5322 cases that met the inclusion criteria were reported. In this patient group, the prevalence of tobacco smoking was 22.2% (CI 21.0-23.5%), while the prevalence of illicit drug use was 11.8% (CI 10.9-12.7%). The predictors for smoking were the absence of alcohol-specific parental rule-setting, lower educational level, non-traditional family structure and positive drug screening. The predictors for illicit drug use were the absence of alcohol-specific parental rule-setting and smoking. Illicit drug use was also associated with a lower BAC at the time of admission.ConclusionsAssessing smoking and illicit drug use among adolescents admitted for acute alcohol intoxication is important in acute cases of intoxication, for outpatient follow-up and for the purposes of prevention. The relationship between simultaneous illicit drug use and a lower BAC is of relevance for paediatricians' attempts to diagnose acute intoxication. With respect to outpatient follow-up and preventive measures, it is important to be aware that adolescents' alcohol consumption, tobacco and illicit drug use are related and, ultimately, increase the odds of using other substances.",Tobacco use,Pediatrics

Obtaining such estimates remains methodologically challenging, with a recent addition to the health economists' toolbox, which is based on well-being data: The well-being valuation approach. Using general population panel data from Germany, we put this approach to the test by investigating several empirical and conceptual challenges, such as the appropriate functional specification of income utility, the choice of health utility tariffs, or the health state dependence of consumption utility. Depending on specification, the bulk of estimated euro per QALY values ranged from euro20,000-60,000, with certain specifications leading to more considerable deviations, underlining persistent practical challenges when applying the well-being valuation methodology to health and QALYs.

Heterogeneity in questionnaires used to evaluate the HRQoL in MBC patients complicates the interpretability and comparability of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) globally. In this review, we aimed to provide an overview of PRO instruments used in real-world MBC patients and to discuss important issues in measuring HRQoL. Routinely collecting symptom information using PROs could enhance treatment evaluation and shared decision-making. Standardizing these measures might help to improve the implementation of PROs, and facilitates collecting and sharing data to establish valid comparisons in research. This is a prerequisite to learn about how they could impact the clinical care pathway. In addition, the prognostic value of intensified PRO collection throughout therapy on survival and disease progression is promising. Future perspectives in the field of PROs and MBC are described.",patient reported outcomes,Oncology

Important influences of social cohesion, education, and income on people's health behaviours have been recognised in Western countries. However, little is known about these influences in the older Chinese population. Objective: To investigate associations of social cohesion and socioeconomic status (SES) with health behaviours among middle-aged and older adults in China. Methods: We used data from the World Health Organization's Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health. Logistic regression and multivariate linear regression were performed. Results: Participants who reported greater social cohesion were more likely to have adequate vegetable and fruit (VF) consumption, be socially active, and less likely to smoke daily, but were not physically more active; participants with lower education levels were less likely to have adequate VF consumption and be socially active, and more likely to smoke daily; higher incomes were associated with decreased odds of daily smoking, increased odds of adequate VF consumption, increased likelihood to be socially active, but also less likelihood to have sufficient physical activity (PA). Associations of social cohesion and SES with health behaviours (smoking, PA, and VF consumption) differed between men and women. Discussion: Our findings are an essential step toward a fuller understanding of the roles of social cohesion and SES in protecting healthy behaviours among older adults.",health behaviour,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

As part of the SELFIE project, 17 integrated care programmes addressing multi-morbidity from eight European countries were selected and studied. Data was extracted from 'thick descriptions' of the 17 programmes and analysed both inductively and deductively using implementation theory. The following ten mechanisms for successful implementation of integrated care were identified. With regards to service delivery, successful implementers (1) commonly adopted an incremental growth model rather than a disruptive innovation approach, and found (2) a balance between flexibility and formal structures of integration. For leadership & governance, they (3) applied collaborative governance by engaging all stakeholders, and (4) distributed leadership throughout all levels of the system. For the workforce, these implementers (5) were able to build a multidisciplinary team culture with mutual recognition of each other's roles, and (6) stimulated the development of new roles and competencies for integrated care. With respect to financing, (7) secured long-term funding and innovative payments were applied as means to overcome fragmented financing of health and social care. Implementers emphasised (8) the implementation of ICT that was specifically developed to support collaboration and communication rather than administrative procedures (technology & medical devices), and (9) created feedback loops and a continuous monitoring system (information & research). The overarching mechanism was that implementers (10) engaged in alignment work across the different components and levels of the health and social care system. These evidence-based mechanisms for implementation are applicable in different local, regional and national contexts.",Europe,Biomedical Social Sciences

As a step towards that, WHO developed iSupport - an online program to provide support and training for caregivers of people with dementia. To address the need of caregivers in India, the iSupport program was adapted to the Indian cultural setting. The process of adaptation consisted of four phases: (a) information gathering (review of literature and focus group discussions), (b) preliminary adaptation design (modifications using an adaptation guide), (c) preliminary adaptation tests (face-to-face interviews and online test run), and (d) adaptation refinement (final modifications to the intervention and study process). The initial adaptation was carried out by effecting changes in words, names, resources, caregiving scenarios and audio files to make the English version of iSupport suitable to the Indian cultural context. The results of the qualitative adaptation tests provided additional recommendations like changing the links to India specific websites, revising the eligibility criterion for caregiving duration, re-wording of e-mail texts, inclusion of a time estimate required to complete the assessments and decreasing the numbers of screens that the caregivers had to navigate in the program, which were incorporated in the final phase. Preliminary data showed that the caregivers who participated in the adaptation process found the changes acceptable.

Challenges of prospectively exploring stakeholder engagement in research,"Stakeholder engagement in research is increasingly viewed as making a major contribution to assisting impact. This paper draws on a longitudinal, prospective impact study exploring stakeholder engagement in a 3-year tobacco control research project which used stakeholder engagement in the development, testing and dissemination of its return on investment tool. The paper presents the challenges of data collection when undertaking prospective research on stakeholder engagement in health-related research. The impact study used mixed methods of data collection to explore stakeholder engagement in the target project, comprising surveys, interviews and observations of meetings and events involving stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement that actually occurred in the target project, and the data collection methods of stakeholder engagement that were actually used in the impact study, varied substantially from those intended in each case. Data collection for the impact study was dependent on the target project's stakeholder engagement, which became substantially reduced. Modifications to data collection for the impact study were required. One of the reasons for the reduction of stakeholder engagement was linked to constraints on the target project to meet non-negotiable deadlines. Another factor was concerns about overburdening stakeholders. The knock-on effect of reduced stakeholder engagement highlighted the impact study's lack of control over its data collection, which was related to the prospective nature of the study. The authors acknowledge that an advantage of a retrospective approach over a prospective one is researchers knowing about data availability and accessibility from the outset. However, the prospective approach of the impact study enabled insight into stakeholder engagement in real-time: how and when it occurred, the challenges, and the experiences of stakeholders and the target project researchers. While the quantity of data gathered was considerably less than anticipated, the quality of data was rich and enabled the impact study objectives to be achieved. With increasing emphasis on public engagement in research and calls for engagement to be evaluated for impact, this paper aims-by highlighting the challenges the impact study experienced-to provide some insight to future research that seeks to respond to those calls.",,Social Sciences - Other Topics

Methods A targeted literature review of methodological papers was performed for an overview of modelling challenges in PM. Expert interviews were held to discuss best modelling practice. A systematic literature review of economic evaluations of PM was conducted to gain insight into current modelling practice. The findings were synthesised and used to develop a set of draft recommendations. The draft recommendations were discussed at a stakeholder workshop and subsequently finalised. Results Twenty-two methodological papers were identified. Some argued that the challenges in modelling PM can be addressed within existing methodological frameworks, others disagreed. Eighteen experts were interviewed. They believed large uncertainty to be a key concern. Out of 195 economic evaluations of PM identified, 56% addressed none of the identified modelling challenges. A set of 23 recommendations was developed. Eight recommendations focus on the modelling of test-treatment pathways. The use of non-randomised controlled trial data is discouraged but several recommendations are provided in case randomised controlled trial data are unavailable. The parameterisation of structural uncertainty is recommended. Other recommendations consider perspective and discounting; premature survival data; additional value elements; patient and clinician compliance; and managed entry agreements.

This study characterizes the interventions implemented in practice as part of the PCC improvement program and describes the experiences of healthcare professionals and patients with the resulting PCC delivery.MethodsThis study employed a mixed-methods design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine general practitioners and nurse practitioners from seven primary care practices in Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands, that participated in the program (which included interventions and workshops). The qualitative interview data were examined using thematic analysis. A longitudinal survey was conducted with 138 patients with multimorbidity from these practices to assess perceived improvements in PCC and its underlying dimensions. Paired sample t tests were performed to compare survey responses obtained at a 1-year interval corresponding to program implementation.ResultsThe PCC improvement program is described, and themes necessary for PCC improvement according to healthcare professionals were generated [e.g. Aligning information to patients' needs and backgrounds, adapting a coaching role]. PCC experiences of patients with multimorbidity improved significantly during the year in which the PCC interventions were implemented (t=2.66, p=0.005).ConclusionThis study revealed how primary PCC can be improved for patients with multimorbidity. It emphasizes the importance of investing in PCC improvement programs to tailor care delivery to heterogenous patients with multimorbidity with diverse care needs. This study generates new perspectives on care delivery and highlights opportunities for its improvement according to the eight dimensions of PCC for patients with multimorbidity in a primary care setting.",Care delivery,General & Internal Medicine

Actors in funding bodies experience similar tensions, however. While projectification necessitates predictability and individual project objectives, research funding is also increasingly organized in networks promoting local experimentation. Moreover, funding bodies are part of a system of accountability in which investments are legitimized politically in often reductionist ways. We argue for the salience of more detailed empirical investigations into the work of funding bodies as they navigate these tensions. We apply a dramaturgical perspective to investigate the ""staging work"" of program committees responsible for the management of funded programs, identifying three forms of staging work: setting the scene, temporal narration, and signifying success. All come with discursive, material, and symbolic dimensions. We develop the notion ""adaptive coherence"" to show how the program committee sought to maintain the coherence of the overall program despite continuous risks of fragmentation due to projectification, local experimentation, and divergence in interests. ""Adaptive coherence"" proves productive in incorporating the temporal and spatial dimensions of staging work in networked contexts.",adaptive coherence,Social Issues

Healthcare organisations faced acute problems, the answers to which had to be provided, and recalibrated, at short notice and informally. University hospitals played a pivotal role in providing these answers and in (re)calibrating institutional arrangements. Based on ethnographic research in an elite university hospital in the Netherlands, in this article we explore the concrete practices of governing risks and uncertainties that COVID-19 posed for the organisation of healthcare. Our fieldwork consisted of the observation of meetings at the level of the hospital boards, the staff, and the regional level. We collected relevant documents and interviewed key-actors. This approach offers us a large dataset on acute risk governance 'from within' and allows us to offer a layered ethnographic account of managerial practices. In our analysis we focus on conceptualising the work-as-done in the university hospital as risk work. We show how the risk work of our participants is generally characterised by high speed and delineated by scarcities. We differentiate between three modes of risk work: working on numbers, working on expertise and working on logistics. This risk work appears innovative, but our analysis stresses how participants' work happened in interaction with traditional institutional logics and routines.",organisational ethnography,Biomedical Social Sciences

We aimed to assess the extent to which the outcomes used by regulators and HTA agencies are patient-relevant, by comparing these to ICHOM standard sets. We conducted a cross-sectional comparative analysis of ICHOM standard sets, and publicly available regulatory and HTA assessment guidelines. We focused on oncology due to many new medicines being developed, which are accompanied by substantial uncertainty regarding the relevance of these treatments for patients. A comparison of regulatory and HTA assessment guidelines, and ICHOM standard sets showed that both ICHOM and regulators stress the importance of disease-specific outcomes. On the other hand, HTA agencies have a stronger focus on generic outcomes in order to allow comparisons across disease areas. Overall, similar outcomes are relevant for market access, reimbursement, and in ICHOM standard sets. However, some differences are apparent, such as the acceptability of intermediate outcomes. These are recommended in ICHOM standard sets, but regulators are more likely to accept intermediate outcomes than HTA agencies. A greater level of alignment in outcomes accepted may enhance the efficiency of regulatory and HTA processes, and increase timely access to new medicines. ICHOM standard sets may help align these outcomes. However, some differences in outcomes used may remain due to the different purposes of regulatory and HTA decision-making.",regulatory,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to synthesize existing evidence on the effect of smoking status on health expectancy and to examine whether smoking elimination leads to compression of morbidity. Methods: Five databases were systematically searched for peer-reviewed articles. Studies that presented quantitative estimates of health expectancy for smokers and non-/never-smokers were eligible for inclusion. Studies were searched, selected and reviewed by two reviewers who extracted the relevant data and assessed the risk of bias of the included articles independently. Results: The search identified 2491 unique records, whereof 20 articles were eligible for inclusion (including 26 cohorts). The indicators used to measure health included disability/activity limitations (n =9), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) (n =2), weighted disabilities (n =1) , self-rated health (n =9), chronic diseases (n =6), cardiovascular diseases (n =4) and cognitive impairment (n =1) . Available evidence showed consistently that non-/never-smokers experience more healthy life years throughout their lives than smokers. Findings were inconsistent on the effect of smoking on the absolute number of unhealthy life years. Findings concerning the time proportionally spent unhealthy were less heterogeneous: nearly all included articles reported that non-/never-smokers experience relatively less unhealthy life years (e.g. relative compression of morbidity). Conclusions: Support for the relative compression of morbidity due to smoking elimination was evident.

A qualitative interview study on five recent cases of active disinvestment,"BackgroundRecent attempts of active disinvestment (i.e. withdrawal of reimbursement by means of a policy decision) of reimbursed healthcare interventions in the Netherlands have differed in their outcome: some attempts were successful, with interventions actually being disinvested. Other attempts were terminated at some point, implying unsuccessful disinvestment. This study aimed to obtain insight into recent active disinvestment processes, and to explore what aspects affect their outcome.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted from January to December 2018 with stakeholders (e.g. patients, policymakers, physicians) who were involved in the policy process of five cases for which the full or partial withdrawal of reimbursement was considered in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2017: benzodiazepines, medication for Fabry disease, quit smoking programme, psychoanalytic therapy and maternity care assistance. These cases covered both interventions that were eventually disinvested and interventions for which reimbursement was maintained after consideration. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, double coded and analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsThe 37 interviews showed that support for disinvestment from stakeholders, especially from healthcare providers and policymakers, strongly affected the outcome of the disinvestment process. Furthermore, the institutional role of stakeholders as legitimized by the Dutch health insurance system, their financial interests in maintaining or discontinuing reimbursement, and the possibility to relieve the consequences of disinvestment for current patients affected the outcome of the disinvestment process as well. A poor organization of patient groups may make it difficult for patients to exert pressure, which may contribute to successful disinvestment. No evidence was found of a consistent role of the formal Dutch package criteria (i.e. effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, necessity and feasibility) in active disinvestment processes.ConclusionsContextual factors as well as the possibility to relieve the consequences of disinvestment for current patients are important determinants of the outcome of active disinvestment processes. These results provide insight into active disinvestment processes and their determinants, and provide guidance to policymakers for a potentially more successful approach for future active disinvestment processes.",Qualitative research,Health Care Sciences & Services

The aim of this study was to investigate the preferences of the general population for communicating health check results. Methods A randomly selected sample of the Swedish population aged 40-70 years completed a discrete choice experiment survey that included questions on sociodemographics, lifestyle and health and 15 choice questions consisting of six attributes (written results, notification method, consultation time, waiting time, lifestyle recommendation and cost). Data were analyzed with a latent class analysis (LCA). Relative importance of the attributes and predicted uptake for several scenarios were estimated. Results In the analysis, 432 individuals were included (response rate 29.6%). A three-class LCA model best fit the data. Cost was the most important attribute in all classes. Preferences heterogeneity was found for the other attributes; in Class 1, receiving consultation time and the written results were important, respondents in Class 2 dominated on costs and respondents in Class 3 found consultation time, waiting time and lifestyle recommendations to be important. Health literate respondents were more likely to belong to Class 3. The predicted uptake rates ranged from 7 to 88% for different health checks with large differences across the classes. Conclusion Cost was most important when deciding whether to participate in a health check.

However, too often, the buzz about worker well-being, enthusiasm for new programs to promote it and interest to research it, have not been accompanied by universal enthusiasm for scientific measurement. Aim to bridge this gap, we address three questions. To address the question 'What is worker well-being?', we explain that worker well-being is a multi-facetted concept and that it can be operationalized in a variety of constructs. We propose a four-dimensional taxonomy of worker well-being constructs to illustrate the concept's complexity and classify ten constructs within this taxonomy. To answer the question 'How can worker well-being constructs be measured?', we present two aspects of measures: measure obtrusiveness (i.e., the extent to which obtaining a measure interferes with workers' experiences) and measure type (i.e., closed question survey, word, behavioral and physiological). We illustrate the diversity of measures across our taxonomy and uncover some hitherto under-appreciated avenues for measuring worker well-being. Finally, we address the question 'How should a worker well-being measure be selected?' by discussing conceptual, methodological, practical and ethical considerations when selecting a measure. We summarize these considerations in a short checklist. It is our hope that with this study researchers - working in organizations, in academia or both - will feel more competent to find effective strategies for the measurement worker well-being and eventually make policies and choices with a better understanding of what drives worker well-being.",Survey,Social Sciences - Other Topics

However, the long treatment duration (i.e. two years or longer) has a high impact on patients and healthcare systems in terms of (severe) toxicity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), resource use, and healthcare costs. While durable tumour responses have been observed and PD-1 blockade is discontinued on an individual basis, no consensus has been reached on the optimal treatment duration. The objective of the Safe Stop trial is to evaluate whether early discontinuation of first-line PD-1 blockade is safe in patients with advanced and metastatic melanoma who achieve a radiological response.MethodsThe Safe Stop trial is a nationwide, multicentre, prospective, single-arm, interventional study in the Netherlands. A total of 200 patients with advanced and metastatic cutaneous melanoma and a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) v1.1 will be included to early discontinue first-line monotherapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The primary objective is the rate of ongoing responses at 24 months after discontinuation of PD-1 blockade. Secondary objectives include best overall and duration of response, need and outcome of rechallenge with PD-1 blockade, and changes in (serious) adverse events and HRQoL. The impact of treatment discontinuation on healthcare resource use, productivity losses, and hours of informal care will also be assessed. Results will be compared to those from patients with CR or PR who completed 24months of treatment with PD-1 blockade and had an ongoing response at treatment discontinuation. It is hypothesised that it is safe to early stop first-line nivolumab or pembrolizumab at confirmed tumour response while improving HRQoL and reducing costs.DiscussionFrom a patient, healthcare, and economic perspective, shorter treatment duration is preferred and overtreatment should be prevented. If early discontinuation of first-line PD-1 blockade appears to be safe, early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade may be implemented as the standard of care in a selected group of patients.Trial registrationThe Safe Stop trial has been registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR), Trial NL7293 (old NTR ID: 7502), https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7293.

The aim of this observational study is to explore the impact of healthcare professional involvement on the adherence of patients to an eHealth platform. We evaluated the usage of an eHealth platform by patients who used the platform individually compared with patients in a blended setting, where healthcare professionals were involved. Methods In this observational cohort study, log data from September 2011 until January 2018 were extracted from the eHealth platform Curavista. Patients with COPD who completed at least one Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) were included for analyses (n = 299). In 57% (n = 171) of the patients, the eHealth platform was used in a blended setting, either in hospital (n = 128) or primary care (n = 29). To compare usage of the platform between patients who used the platform independently or with a healthcare professional, we applied propensity score matching and performed adjusted Poisson regression analysis on CCQ-submission rate. Results Using the eHealth platform in a blended setting was associated with a 3.25 higher CCQ-submission rate compared to patients using the eHealth platform independently. Within the blended setting, the CCQ-submission rate was 1.83 higher in the hospital care group than in the primary care group. Conclusion It is shown that COPD patients used the platform more frequently in a blended care setting compared to patients who used the eHealth platform independently, adjusted for age, sex and disease burden. Blended care seems essential for adherence to eHealth programs in COPD, which in turn may improve self-management.",Adherence,Respiratory System

This assumption may be violated if preference reversals are observed when comparing different methods to elicit people's preferences. People may then prefer A over B using one method while preferring B over A using another. Such preference reversals pose a significant problem for theoretical and applied research. We used a sample of medical and economics students to investigate preference reversals in the health and financial domain when choosing patients/clients. We explored whether preference reversals are associated with domain-relevant training and tested whether using guided 'choice list' elicitation reduces reversals. Our findings suggest that preference reversals were more likely to occur for medical students, within the health domain, and for open-ended valuation questions. Familiarity with a domain reduced the likelihood of preference reversals in that domain. Although preference reversals occur less frequently within specialist domains, they remain a significant theoretical and practical problem. The use of clearer valuation procedures offers a promising approach to reduce preference reversals.",Preference reversals,Health Care Sciences & Services

The objectives: 1) investigate real-world HRQOL of MS patients using both generic and disease-specific HRQOL instruments in the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany and Italy; 2) compare HRQOL among these countries; 3) determine factors associated with HRQOL. Methods A cross-sectional, observational online web-based survey amongst MS patients was conducted in June-October 2019. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and two HRQOL instruments: the generic EuroQOL (EQ-5D-5L) and disease-related Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL)-54, an extension of the generic Short Form-36 (SF-36) was collected. Health utility scores were calculated using country-specific value sets. Mean differences in HRQOL were analysed and predictors of HRQOL were explored in regression analyses. Results In total 182 patients were included (the Netherlands: n = 88; France: n = 58; the United Kingdom: n = 15; Spain: n = 10; living elsewhere: n = 11). Mean MSQOL-54 physical and mental composite scores (42.5, SD:17.2; 58.3, SD:21.5) were lower, whereas the SF-36 physical and mental composite scores (46.8, SD:22.6; 53.1, SD:22.5) were higher than reported in previous clinical trials. The mean EQ-5D utility was 0.65 (SD:0.26). Cross-country differences in HRQOL were found. A common predictor of HRQOL was disability status and primary progressive MS. Conclusions The effects of MS on HRQOL in real-world patients may be underestimated. Combined use of generic and disease-specific HRQOL instruments enhance the understanding of the health needs of MS patients. Consequent use of the same instruments in clinical trials and observational studies improves cross-country comparability of HRQOL.",EQ-5D,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Methods The study was conducted with three population groups in Rotterdam, the Netherlands: native Dutch people aged >= 70 years (n = 1150), Turkish immigrants aged >= 65 years (n = 680) and Moroccan immigrants aged >= 65 years (n = 292). To assess participants' internal ageing representations, we used the short Aging Perceptions Questionnaire, which distinguishes negative (consequences, chronic and cyclical timeline awareness, and emotional representations) and positive (positive consequences, positive and negative control) dimensions and has been validated in native and immigrant populations. We analysed differences in ageing perceptions between immigrants and natives and the associations of ageing perceptions with SRH. We used Karlson-Holm-Breen decomposition to assess ageing perceptions' mediation of the relationship between migration background and SRH. Results Older immigrants had stronger negative and weaker positive ageing perceptions (excepting the positive consequences of ageing) than did Dutch natives. Ageing perceptions mediated the relationship between migration background and SRH. SRH differences between Turkish immigrants and native Dutch older persons were explained mainly by differences in negative consequences and cyclical timeline awareness. SRH differences between Moroccan immigrants and native Dutch older persons were attributable mainly to differences in negative consequences and positive control. Conclusions Differences in positive and negative ageing perceptions between older immigrants and natives in the Netherlands largely explained SRH differences between these population groups.",Netherlands,Geriatrics & Gerontology

We therefore conducted a population survey to describe: 1) stress, concerns and quality of life 2) access to healthcare and cancelled/delayed healthcare and 3) productivity during the first 8weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in the general population.MethodsAn online cross-sectional survey was conducted in a representative sample after 8weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in Belgium and the Netherlands. The survey included a series of three validated questionnaires about quality of life delayed/cancelled medical care and productivity loss using validated questionnaires.ResultsIn total, 2099 Belgian and 2058 Dutch respondents completed the survey with a mean age of 46.4 and 42.0years, respectively. Half of the respondents were female in both countries. A small proportion tested positive for COVID-19, 1.4% vs 4.7%, respectively. The majority of respondents with a medical condition was worried about their current health state due to the pandemic (53%) vs (63%), respectively. Respondents experienced postponed/cancelled care (26%) and were concerned about the availability of medication (32%) for both countries. Productivity losses due to the COVID-19 restrictions were calculated in absenteeism (36%) and presenteeism (30%) for Belgium, and (19%) and (35%) for the Netherlands. Most concerns and productivity losses were reported by respondents with children <12years, respondents aged 18-35 and respondents with an (expected) COVID-19 infection.ConclusionsThis study describes stress, quality of life, medical resource loss and productivity losses in Belgium and the Netherlands after 8weeks of coronavirus lockdown.

Cognitive burden of discrete choice experiment and case 2 best-worst scaling in an online setting,"To appropriately weight dimensions of quality of life instruments for health economic evaluations, population and patient preferences need to be elicited. Two commonly used elicitation methods for this purpose are discrete choice experiments (DCE) and case 2 best-worst scaling (BWS). These methods differ in terms of their cognitive burden, which is especially relevant when eliciting preferences among older people. Using a randomised experiment with respondents from an online panel, this paper examines the cognitive burden associated with colour-coded and level overlapped DCE, colour-coded BWS, and 'standard' BWS choice tasks in a complex health state valuation setting. Our sample included 469 individuals aged 65 and above. Based on both revealed and stated cognitive burden, we found that the DCE tasks were less cognitively burdensome than case 2 BWS. Colour coding case 2 BWS cannot be recommended as its effect on cognitive burden was less clear and the colour coding lead to undesired choice heuristics. Our results have implications for future health state valuations of complex quality of life instruments and at least serve as an example of assessing cognitive burden associated with different types of choice experiments.",Colour coding,Business & Economics

In addition, we examine whether these trends are related to unequal changes in avoidable mortality, separated by preventable and treatable causes of death. We find that while inequalities in mortality have decreased at ages up to 65, inequalities increased for the oldest age groups. The decline in inequality at the younger ages can, to a large extent, be explained by a strong decrease of mortality from preventable and cardiovascular causes among the poor. The link between inequality and avoidable mortality at the oldest ages is less straightforward. The increasing inequality at old age might be the result of the inequalities shifting from the young to the older age groups, or of the rich benefiting more from the recent health (care) improvements than the poor.",poverty,Business & Economics

As neuromuscular disorders represent multisystem, debilitating, and progressive rare diseases with few treatment options, this study aimed to explore unmet health care needs and patient treatment preferences for two neuromuscular disorders, myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and mitochondrial myopathies (MM) to inform early stages of drug development. Methods Fifteen semi-structured interviews and five focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with DM1 and MM adult patients and caregivers. Topics discussed included (1) reasons for study participation; (2) disease signs/symptoms and their impact on daily lives; (3) top desired benefits; and (4) acceptability of risks and tolerance levels for a hypothetical new treatment. Data were analyzed following a thematic 'code' approach. Results A total of 52 participants representing a wide range of disease severities participated. 'Muscle strength' and 'energy and endurance' were the disease-related unmet needs most often mentioned. Additionally, improved 'balance', 'cognition' and 'gut function' were the top desired treatment benefits, while 'damage to the liver, kidneys or eyes' was the most concerning risk. Factors influencing their tolerance to risks related to previously having experienced the risk and differentiation between permanent and temporary risks. A few differences were elicited between patients and caregivers. Conclusions This qualitative study provided an open forum to elicit treatment-desired benefits and acceptable risks to be established by patients themselves. These findings can inform decisions for developing new treatments and the design of clinical trials for DM1 and MM.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

How this burden is distributed across income groups depends on the design of the co-payment. We estimate the lifecycle dynamics of LTC using Dutch administrative data. These estimates are inputs in a stochastic lifecycle decision model. Using the model, we analyze the welfare effects of the Dutch income- and wealth-dependent co-payment system and compare it to alternative systems. We find that the Dutch co-payment system redistributes income to low-income groups, who use the most care over their life but contribute the least co-payments, from high-income groups, who pay the most. Moreover, the Dutch system protects the middle-income groups relatively well against financial risk: although alternative co-payment systems hardly affect these groups average payments, they induce welfare losses of 2% to 4% due to an increased risk of very high co-payments.",semiparametric modeling,Business & Economics

We assessed whether drugs were primarily designed to treat AML or were repurposed and how successful they were based on progression of distinct drugs from phase II to phase III to FDA-approval. Between January 2000 and September 2020, 167 agents with 96 targets were investigated in 397 phase II trials. Twenty-eight agents were steered towards phase III, after three phase II trials on average. Repurposed drugs less often advanced in clinical development than drugs primarily developed for AML. Composite responses were the most prevalent primary endpoints in phase II. Of the eight FDA-approved drugs, none investigated quality of life at time of approval, and three out of eight have yet to show benefit in overall survival.

We focused on the former France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom (EU-5) and the Netherlands. We conducted a review of list prices, health technology assessment reports, budget impact analysis dossiers, and published cost-effectiveness analyses. We forecasted the 10-year health expenditures on CAR T-cells for several hematological cancers in selected European Union countries. Nine cost-effectiveness studies were identified and list prices for CAR T-cell therapies ranged between 307 200 EUR and 350 000 EUR. Estimated additional costs for pre- and post-treatment were 50 359 EUR per patient, whereas the incremental costs of CAR T-cell therapy (when compared with care as usual) ranged between 276 086 EUR and 328 727 EUR. We estimated market entry of CAR T-cell therapies for chronic mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia in 2021, 2022, 2022, 2022, and 2025, respectively. Cumulative expenditure estimates for existing and future indications from 2019 to 2029 were on average 28.5 billion EUR, 32.8 billion EUR, and 28.9 billion EUR when considering CAR T-cell therapy costs only, CAR T-cell therapy costs including pre- and post-treatment, and incremental CAR T-cell therapy costs, respectively.

An essential determinant of the virus' spread is a series of individual decisions, such as wearing face masks in public space. Those decisions depend on trade-offs between costs (or benefits) and risks, and beliefs are key to explain these. Methods We elicit beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic during lockdown in France by means of surveys asking French citizens about their belief of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) for COVID-19, own risk to catch the disease, risk as perceived by others, and expected prevalence rate. Those self-assessments were measured twice during lockdown: about 2 weeks after lockdown started and about 2 weeks before lockdown ended. We also measured the quality of these beliefs with respect to available evidence at the time of the surveys, allowing us to assess the calibration of beliefs based on risk-related socio-demographics. Finally, comparing own risk to expected prevalence rates in the two successive surveys provides a dynamic view of comparative optimism with respect to the disease. Results The risk perceptions are rather high in absolute terms and they increased between the two surveys. We found no evidence for an impact of personal experience with COVID-19 on beliefs and lower risk perceptions of the IFR when someone in the respondent's family has been diagnosed with a disease. Answers to survey 1 confirmed this pattern with a clear indication that respondents were optimistic about their chances to catch COVID-19. However, in survey 2, respondents revealed comparative pessimism. Conclusion The results show that respondents overestimated the probabilities to catch or die from COVID-19, which is not unusual and does not necessarily reflect a strong deviation from rational behavior. While a rational model explains why the own risk to catch COVID-19 rose between the two surveys, it does not explain why the subjective assessment of the IFR remained stable. The comparative pessimism in survey 2 was likely due to a concomitant increase in the respondents' perceived chances to catch the disease and a decreased expected prevalence rate.",risk perception,Psychology

The participants worked as managers (n=40), registered nurses (RNs) or assistant nurses (n=25).ResultsThe analysis identified the two categories and four sub-categories: ""Professional issues: more than firefighting"" (subcategories ""professional pride"" and ""competence"") and ""patient-centered approach: more than covering basic needs"" (subcategories ""dignity"" and ""continuity""). Quality in nursing homes and homecare is conceptualized as an ongoing process based on having the ""right competence,"" good cooperation across professional groups, and patient-centered care, in line with professional pride and dignity for the patients.ConclusionBased on the understanding of quality among the healthcare professionals in our study, quality should encompass the softer dimensions of professional pride and competence, as well as a patient-centered approach to care. These dimensions should be factors in improvement activities and in daily practice.",Netherlands,Health Care Sciences & Services

However, defining good quality indicators and applying them to high-volume care such as skin cancer is not always feasible. Objectives: To determine whether claims data could be used to benchmark high-volume skin cancer care and to assess clinical practice variation. Methods: All skin cancer care-related claims in dermatology in 2016 were extracted from a nationwide claims database (Vektis) in the Netherlands. Results: For over 220,000 patients, a skin cancer diagnosis-related group was reimbursed in 124 healthcare centres. Conventional excision reflected 75% of treatments for skin cancer but showed large variation between practices. Large practice variation was also found for 5-fluorouracil and imiquimod creams. The practice variation of Mohs micrographic surgery and photodynamic therapy was low under the 75th percentile, but outliers at the 100th percentile were detected, which indicates that few centres performed these therapies far more often than average. On average, patients received 1.8 follow-up visits in 2016. Conclusions: Claims data demonstrated large practice variation in treatments and follow-up visits of skin cancer and may be a valid and feasible data set to extract quality indicators. The next step is to investigate whether detected practice variation is unwarranted and if a reduction improves quality and efficiency of care.",Follow-up,Dermatology

Data from the local pharmacy database and patient records of a university hospital in the Netherlands were used. RA patients who started a biological between 2000 and 2020 were included. Data on age, anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) status, presence of erosions, gender, body mass index, time to first biological, biological survival time, use of csDMARDs, and discontinuation reasons were collected. Of the included 318 patients, 12% started their first biological within 6 months after diagnosis. The median time to first biological was 3.6 years (95% CI, 1.0-7.2). The median survival of the first- and second-line biological was respectively 1.7 years (95% CI, 1.3-2.2) and 0.8 years (95% CI, 0.5-1.0) (p = 0.0001). Discontinuation reasons for the first-line biological were ineffectiveness (47%), adverse events (17%), remission (16%), pregnancy (30%), or patient preference (10%). Multivariable Cox regression analyses for discontinuation due to inefficacy or adverse events showed that concomitant use of csDMARDs (HR = 1.32, p < 0.001) positively while RF positivity negatively (HR = 0.82, p = 0.03) influenced biological survival. ACPA positivity was associated with the inability to discontinue biologicals after achieving remission (HR = 1.43, p = 0.023). Second-line TNF inhibitor survival was similar between patients with a primary and secondary non-response on the first-line TNF inhibitor (HR = 1.28, p = 0.34). Biological survival diminishes with the number of biologicals used. Biological survival is prolonged if patients use csDMARDs. RF was negatively associated with biological survival. ACPA was negatively associated with the inability to discontinue biologicals after achieving remission. Therefore, tailoring treatment based upon autoantibody status might be the first step towards personalized medicine in RA.",TNF inhibitor,Rheumatology

It called for governments to give high priority to PHC in partnership with their public and private sector organisations and other stakeholders. Each country has a unique path towards UHC, and different models for public-private partnerships (PPPs) are possible. The goal of this paper is to examine evidence on the use of PPPs in the provision of PHC services, reported challenges and recommendations.MethodsWe systematically reviewed peer-reviewed studies in six databases (ScienceDirect, Ovid Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus) and supplemented it by the search of grey literature. PRISMA reporting guidelines were followed.ResultsSixty-one studies were included in the final review. Results showed that most PPPs projects were conducted to increase access and to facilitate the provision of prevention and treatment services (i.e., tuberculosis, education and health promotion, malaria, and HIV/AIDS services) for certain target groups. Most projects reported challenges of providing PHC via PPPs in the starting and implementation phases. The reported challenges and recommendations on how to overcome them related to education, management, human resources, financial resources, information, and technology systems aspects.ConclusionDespite various challenges, PPPs in PHC can facilitate access to health care services, especially in remote areas. Governments should consider long-term plans and sustainable policies to start PPPs in PHC and should not ignore local needs and context.",Decision-making,Health Care Sciences & Services

In this paper, we generate expert consensus on the most important aspects of VBHC. Design The Delphi technique was used to reach consensus on the most important practices in moving towards a value-based healthcare system. Setting and participants A Dutch expert panel consisting of nine members participated in a two-round survey. Primary and secondary outcome measures We developed 39 initial items based on the pioneering literature on VBHC and recent health policies in the Netherlands. Experts rated the importance of each item on a 4-point Likert scale. Experts could change items or add new ones as they saw fit. We retained items that were rated (very) important by >= 80% of the panel. Results After two survey rounds, 32 items (72%) were included through expert consensus. Experts unanimously agree on the importance of shared decision-making, with this item uniquely obtaining the maximum score. Experts also reached consensus on the importance of outcome measurements, a focus on medical conditions, and full cycles of care. No consensus was reached on the importance of benchmarking. Conclusion This paper provides new insight into the most important actions and practices for establishing a value-based healthcare system in the Netherlands. Interestingly, several of our findings contrast with the pioneering literature on VBHC. This raises the question whether VBHC's widespread international uptake indicates its actual implementation, or rather that the original concept primarily serves as an inspiring idea.",health policy,General & Internal Medicine

A widely-publicised falsified vaccine case in 2016, coupled with a significant financial deficit in the national insurance system, has contributed to concern that the rapid scale-up of UHC might undermine medicine quality. We investigated the political and economic factors that drive production and trade of poor-quality medicines in Indonesia. Methods We reviewed academic publications, government regulations, technical agency documents and news reports to develop a semi-structured questionnaire. We interviewed healthcare providers, policy-makers, medicine regulators, pharmaceutical manufacturers, patients and academics (n=31). We included those with in-depth knowledge about the falsified vaccine case or the pharmaceutical business, medicine regulation, prescribing practice and the implementation of UHC. We coded data using NVivo software and analysed by constant comparative method. Results The scale-up of UHC has cut revenues for physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In the vaccine case, free, quality-assured vaccines were available but some physicians, seeking extra revenue, promoted expensive alternatives. Taking advantage of poor governance in private hospitals, they purchased cut-price 'vaccines' from freelance salespeople. A single-winner public procurement system which does not explicitly consider quality has slashed the price paid for covered medicines. Trade, industrial and religious policies simultaneously increased production costs, pressuring profit margins for manufacturers and distributors. They reacted by cutting costs (potentially threatening quality) or by market withdrawal (leading to shortages which provide a market for falsifiers). Shortages and physician-promoted irrational demand push patients to buy medicines in unregulated channels, increasing exposure to falsified medicines. Conclusion Market factors, including political pressure to reduce medicine prices and healthcare provider incentives, can drive markets for substandard and falsified medicines. To protect progress towards UHC, policy-makers must consider the potential impact on medicine quality when formulating rules governing health financing, procurement, taxation and industry.",qualitative study,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

A political analysis of the problem of evidence-based medicine in the layered Dutch healthcare system,"We critically examine the discussion on the role of evidence-based medicine (EBM) in healthcare governance. We take the institutionally layered Dutch healthcare system as our case study. Here, different actors are involved in the regulation, provision and financing of healthcare services. Over the last decades, these actors have related to EBM to inform their actor specific roles. At the same time, EBM has increasingly been problematised. To better understand this problematisation, we organised focus groups and interviews. We noticed that particularly EBM's reductionist epistemology and its uncritical use by 'professional others' are considered problematic. However, our analysis also reveals that something else seems to be at stake. In fact, all the actors involved underwrite EBM's reductionist epistemology and emphasise that evidence should be contextualised. They however do so in different ways and with different contexts in mind. Moreover, the ways in which some actors contextualise evidence has consequences for the ways in which others can do the same. We therefore emphasise that behind EBM's scientific problematisation lurks a political issue. A dispute over who should contextualise evidence how, in a layered healthcare system with interdependent actors that cater to both individual patients and the public. We urge public administration scholars and policymakers to open-up the political confrontation between healthcare actors and their sometimes irreconcilable, yet evidence-informed perspectives.

However, one of the main challenges of integrating patient preferences in benefit-risk decision-making is understanding differences in patient preference, which may be attributable to clinical characteristics (eg age, medical history) or psychosocial factors. Measuring the latter may provide valuable information to decision-makers but there is limited guidance regarding which psychological dimensions may influence patient preferences and which psychological instruments should be considered for inclusion in patient preference studies. This paper aims to provide such guidance by advancing evidence and consensus-based recommendations and considerations. Findings of a recent systematic review on psychological constructs having an impact on patients' preferences and health-related decisions were expanded with input from an expert group (n = 11). These data were then used as the basis for final recommendations developed through two rounds of formal evaluation via an online Delphi consensus process involving international experts in the field of psychology, medical decision-making, and risk communication (n = 27). Three classes of recommendations emerged. Eleven psychological constructs reached consensus to be recommended for inclusion with the strongest consensus existing for health literacy, numeracy, illness perception and treatment-related beliefs. We also proposed a set of descriptive and checklist criteria to appraise available psychological measures to assist researchers and other stakeholders in including psychological assessment when planning patient preference studies. These recommendations can guide researchers and other stakeholders when designing and interpreting patient preference studies with a potential high impact in clinical practice and medical product benefit-risk decision-making processes.",decision-making,General & Internal Medicine

The health impact of providing informal care in the UK and the Netherlands,"We explore whether the health impact of providing informal care differs by country once similar caregivers, in terms of the intensity of provided care, are compared. In both countries we find negative mental health effects of providing informal care. While these effects slightly differ by country, the main differences arise between subgroups of caregivers. Individuals that provide more than 20 hours of informal care per week, and those who face a double burden of care and full-time employment experience the most severe negative mental health effects. These results indicate that health effects of providing informal care are mediated by the specific caregiving context, allowing policymakers to use information on this context to provide targeted aid. In addition, it suggests that previously reported differences of caregiving effects across countries could be driven by differences in the population of informal caregivers which are shaped by countries' LTC policies.",Country comparison,Biomedical Social Sciences

By contrast, in publicly financed long-term care (LTC) needs assessment is often delegated to an independent assessor. One rationale offered for independent needs assessment in LTC is to limit the scope for moral hazard and supplier-induced demand, which may be particularly strong in case of public LTC insurance. We study whether independent needs assessment restricts use of publicly financed LTC at the intensive margin (i.e. after people are being assessed to be eligible for receiving care). Therefore, we link nationwide Dutch administrative datasets about individual LTC use and eligibility decisions by the independent assessment agency in 2012. We find for virtually all types of care, all population subgroups, and all regions that LTC use by patients was substantially less than the maximum amount of care allowed by the independent assessor. This suggests that in the Netherlands independent needs assessment in LTC does not impose a binding constraint on use once a person is considered eligible for care. Still, independent needs assessment may have reduced LTC use at the extensive margin. A significant proportion of the applications for care (16 %) was rejected. In addition, the independent assessment may deter some people from applying. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.",Moral hazard,Health Care Sciences & Services

Managers of healthcare organisations play an important role in quality and safety improvement. We need more research in the nursing home and homecare settings to support managers in their quality and safety improvement work. The aim of this study was to explore managers' response to a leadership intervention on quality and safety improvement. Methods This study reports findings from the SAFE-LEAD intervention undertaken from April 2018 to March 2019. The research design was a multiple case study of two nursing homes and two homecare services in four municipalities in Norway. We used a combination of qualitative methods including interviews, workshops, observations, site visits and document analysis in our data collection that took place over a 1-year period. Results Management continuity was key for the implementation process of the quality and safety leadership intervention. In the units where stable management teams were in place, the intervention was more rooted in the units, and changes in quality and safety practice occurred. The intervention served as an arena for managers to work with quality and safety improvement. We found that the workshops and use of the leadership guide contributed to a common understanding and commitment to quality and safety improvement among the managers. Conclusions This is a longitudinal study of managers' response to a leadership intervention targeted to improve quality and safety work in nursing home and homecare settings. Our research demonstrates how the mechanisms of stable management and established structures are crucial for quality and safety improvement activities.

Such systems in the most extensive versions generally mandate a scan at every point of contact with the medical product: from the point of entry to dispensation. There have been several attempts to implement such systems; for example, a 'full' PTTS in Turkey and the more pared-down version offered by the European Union's Falsified Medicines Directive and Delegated Act. This study aims to identify facilitators and barriers to implementing (elements of) a PTTS, with the Turkish system used as a benchmark. Methods We conducted a 'realist' review, which synthesises literature and aims to establish how a specific technology works, for whom, under which circumstances. We searched Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Central and Google Scholar databases, yielding 2,790 scholarly articles. We selected 21 for review. Results Implementation of PTTS elements has been attempted in different compositions in several primarily high-income and middle-income countries. Factors that affected implementation included stakeholders like the government and supply chain actors, the coordination between them, and their awareness, knowledge, and skills, as well as regulation and legislation, monetary investments, and technical and digital requirements. Conclusion The interplay between contextual factors is crucial for successful PTTS implementation. Specifically, the findings indicate that aligning the incentives for all actors and allowing for adjustments in a continuous implementation process will likely facilitate implementation.",review,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

It specifically addresses patient-level indicators for cataract surgery. Design A mixed-methods case study comparing Singapore and The Netherlands Setting Singapore (2017-2019) and The Netherlands (2014-2015). Participants Stakeholder representatives of cataract care in Singapore and The Netherlands. Intervention Based on the previously identified complete set of stakeholders in The Netherlands, we identified stakeholders of cataract care in Singapore. Stakeholder representatives then established a multi-stakeholder perspective on the quality of cataract care using a concept mapping approach. This yielded a multidimensional cluster map based on multivariate statistical analyses. Consensus-based quality dimensions were subsequently defined during a plenary session. Thereafter, Singaporean dimensions were matched with dimensions obtained in The Netherlands to identify commonalities and differences. Main outcome measure Health-services quality dimensions of cataract care. Results 19 Singaporean stakeholders representing patients, general practitioners, ophthalmologists, nurses, care providers, researchers and clinical auditors defined health-services quality of cataract care using the following eight dimensions: clinical outcome, patient outcomes, surgical process, surgical safety, patient experience, access, cost and standards of care. Compared with the Dutch results, 61% of the indicators were allocated to dimensions of comparable names and compositions. Considerable differences also existed in the composition of some dimensions and the importance attached to indicators. Conclusions and relevance This study on cataract care in Singapore and The Netherlands shows that cataract care quality measurement instruments can share a common international core. At the same time, it emphasises the importance of taking a country-specific multi-stakeholder approach to quality definition and measurement. Complementing an international core set with country-specific measures is required to ensure that the included dimensions and indicators adequately capture the country-specific quality views.",cataract and refractive surgery,General & Internal Medicine

This protocol describes a PREFER clinical case study which compares two preference elicitation methodologies across several populations and provides information about benefit-risk trade-offs by those at risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for preventive interventions. Methods and analysis This mixed methods study will be conducted in three countries (UK, Germany, Romania) to assess preferences of (1) first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with RA and (2) members of the public. Focus groups using nominal group techniques (UK) and ranking surveys (Germany and Romania) will identify and rank key treatment attributes. Focus group transcripts will be analysed thematically using the framework method and average rank orders calculated. These results will inform the treatment attributes to be assessed in a survey including a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and a probabilistic threshold technique (PTT). The survey will also include measures of sociodemographic variables, health literacy, numeracy, illness perceptions and beliefs about medicines. The survey will be administered to (1) 400 FDRs of patients with RA (UK); (2) 100 FDRs of patients with RA (Germany); and (3) 1000 members of the public in each of UK, Germany and Romania.

Design/methodology/approach This paper draws on action-oriented research involving experiments aimed at designing, implementing and evaluating promising solutions to the entwined problems of a burgeoning elderly population and an increasing shortage of medical staff. It draws on ethnographic research conducted in 14 administrative areas in the Netherlands, a total of 273 in-depth interviews and over 1,000 h of observations. Findings This research challenges the understanding of a healthcare region as a clearly bounded topological area. It shows that organizations and professionals collaborate in a variety of different networks, some conterminous with the administrative region established by policymakers and others not. These networks are by nature unstable and dynamic. Attempts to form new regional collaborations with neighbouring organizations are complicated by existing healthcare governance and accountability structures that position organizations as competitors. Practical implications Policymakers should take the pre-established partnerships of healthcare organizations into account before delineating the area in which regionalization is meant to take place. A better alignment of governance and accountability structures is also needed for regionalization to occur in healthcare.

Lessons Learned From Digital Interviewer-Assisted Time Trade-Off Data Collection,"The preferred mode of administration of time trade-off (TTO) in large-scale valuation studies is face-to-face (personal) interviews facilitated by a trained interviewer. Geographical, financial or situational constraints could complicate personal TTO interviews. When facing such constraints, the use of digital interviews, in which trained interviewers facilitate through videotelephony software (i.e. tele-TTO) may be considered. This paper aims to guide researchers in how to approach tele-TTO interviews and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. The main advantages of tele-TTO compared to personal TTO are decreased need for travel and increased flexibility of interview scheduling, which could reduce costs and may foster representative sampling. Possible disadvantages of tele-TTO are partial loss of visual cues, complications with building rapport and possible selection effects that result from differences in interview preparation. Furthermore, the paper reports on lessons learned from a project in which both personal TTO and tele-TTO interviews were conducted. The results of this project suggest that although they require a different recruitment and interview process, tele-TTO interviews are feasible and provide flexibility to the interviewer. Furthermore, tele-TTO interviews yield largely similar results. Future research should explore the role of possible selection effects and respondents' perspective on tele-TTO interviews.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

This study assesses patient preferences for attributes of second-line therapies and heterogeneity within these preferences to estimate the relative importance of treatment characteristics and to calculate the minimum benefit levels patients require to accept higher levels of side effects. Methods Between November 2018 to August 2019, patients with rheumatoid arthritis were recruited to a survey containing demographic and disease-related questions as well as a discrete choice experiment to measure their preferences for second-line therapies using biologics or Janus kinases inhibitors. Treatment characteristics included were route of administration, frequency of use, probability of mild short-term side effects, probability of side effects changing appearance, probability of psychological side effects, probability of severe side effects and effectiveness of treatment. Results A total of 358 patients were included in the analysis. A latent class analysis revealed three preference patterns: (1) treatment effectiveness as the single most important attribute, (2) route of administration as the most important attribute, closely followed by frequency of use and psychological side effects and (3) severe side effects as the most important attribute followed by psychological side effects. In addition, disease duration and mild side effects influenced the patients' choices. Conclusion Respondents found either effectiveness, route of administration or severe side effects as the most important attribute.

Classic DSA methodologies may lead to wrong conclusions due to a lack of or misleading information regarding marginal effects, non-linearity, likelihood and correlations. In addition, tornado diagrams are misleading in some situations. Recent advances in DSA methods have the potential to provide decision makers with more reliable information regarding the effects of uncertainties in individual parameters. This practical application discusses advances to classic DSA methods and their implications. Three methods are discussed: stepwise DSA, distributional DSA and probabilistic DSA. For each method, the technical specifications, options for presenting results, and its implications for decision making are discussed. Options for visualizing DSA results in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and in incremental net benefits are presented. The use of stepwise DSA increases interpretability of marginal effects and non-linearities in the model, which is especially relevant when arbitrary ranges are implemented. Using the probability distribution of each parameter in distributional DSA provides insight on the likelihood of model outcomes while probabilistic DSA also includes the effects of correlations between parameters. Probabilistic DSA, preferably expressed in incremental net benefit, is the most appropriate method for providing insight on the effect of uncertainty in individual parameters on the estimate of cost effectiveness. However, the opportunities provided by probabilistic DSA may not always be needed for decision making. Other DSA methods, in particular distributional DSA, can sometimes be sufficient depending on model features. Decision makers must determine to which extent they will accept and implement these new and improved DSA methodologies and adjust guidelines accordingly.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

An optimal interaction between a patient and a ventilator is therefore paramount. Suboptimal interaction is present when patients repeatedly demand, but do not receive, breathing support from a mechanical ventilator (> 30 times in 3 min), also known as an ineffective effort event (IEEV). IEEVs are associated with increased hospital mortality prolonged intensive care stay, and prolonged time on ventilation and thus development of real-time analytics that identify IEEVs is essential. To assist decision-making about further development we estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of real-time analytics that identify ineffective effort events. Methods We developed a cost-effectiveness model combining a decision tree and Markov model for long-term outcomes with data on current care from a Greek hospital and literature. A lifetime horizon and a healthcare payer perspective were used. Uncertainty about the results was assessed using sensitivity and scenario analyses to examine the impact of varying parameters like the intensive care costs per day and the effectiveness of treatment of IEEVs. Results Use of the analytics could lead to reduced mortality (3% absolute reduction), increased quality adjusted life years (0.21 per patient) and cost-savings (euro264 per patient) compared to current care. Moreover, cost-savings for hospitals and health improvements can be incurred even if the treatment's effectiveness is reduced from 30 to 10%. The estimated savings increase to euro1,155 per patient in countries where costs of an intensive care day are high (e.g. the Netherlands). There is considerable headroom for development and the analytics generate savings when the price of the analytics per bed per year is below euro7,307. Furthermore, even when the treatment's effectiveness is 10%, the probability that the analytics are cost-effective exceeds 90%. Conclusions Implementing real-time analytics to identify ineffective effort events can lead to health and financial benefits. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to continue assessment of the effectiveness of the analytics in clinical practice and validate our findings. Eventually, their adoption in settings where costs of an intensive care day are high and ineffective efforts are frequent could yield a high return on investment.",Intensive care unit,Health Care Sciences & Services

Yet, systematic insight into the relations across different healthcare sectors is lacking. The aim of this explorative study is twofold. First, to understand how IOC differs across healthcare sectors with regards to characteristics, motives and the role of health policy. Second, to understand which potential effects healthcare executives consider prior to the establishment of the collaborations. For this purpose, a survey was conducted among a representative panel of Dutch healthcare executives from medium-sized or large healthcare organizations. Almost half (n = 344, 48%) of the invited executives participated. Our results suggest that differences in policy changes and institutional developments across healthcare sectors affect the scope and type of IOC: hospitals generally operate in small horizontal collaborations, while larger and more complex mixed and non-horizontal collaborations are more present among nursing homes, disability care and mental care organizations. We find that before establishing IOCs, most healthcare executives conduct a self-assessment including the potential effects of the collaboration. The extensive overview of policy developments, collaboration types and intended outcomes presented in our study offers a useful starting point for a more in-depth assessment of the effectiveness of collaborations among healthcare organizations.",governance,Health Care Sciences & Services

Selection incentives result from the interplay of three market characteristics: possible actions by insurers, consumer response to these actions, and predictable variation in profitability of insurance contracts. After a qualitative analysis of the first two characteristics our primary objective is to identify the third. Using a combination of claims data (N= 16.8 million) and survey information (N= 387,195), we find substantial predictable variation in profitability. On average, people in good health are profitable, while those in poor health are unprofitable. We conclude that Dutch insurers indeed face selection incentives.

These subsidies are typically independent of plan choice leaving the absolute premium differences in place so as not to distort consumer choice of plan. Such subsidies do, however, change the relative premium differences across plans, which, according to theories from behavioral economics, can affect choice. Consumers might be sensitive to differences relative to a reference premium (""relative thinking""). Furthermore, consumers might be particularly sensitive to a reference premium of zero (""zero-price effect""), a relevant range for some subsidized health insurance markets. This paper tests these ideas with two sources of evidence. We argue that observed equilibria in Germany and the U.S. Medicare Advantage markets are consistent with a powerful zero-price effect, resulting in an equilibrium focal pricing at zero. This contrasts with the Netherlands where equilibrium premiums are well above zero. In an empirical test using hypothetical questions in a web-based survey in these three countries, we also find evidence for both a relative thinking and a zero-price effect in the demand for health insurance. Our findings imply that well-designed subsidies can leverage relative thinking to increase demand elasticity for health plans. Creation of a powerful reference price (e.g., at zero), however, risks subverting price competition. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Zero-price effect,Business & Economics

Rare LEP mutations associated with congenital leptin deficiency cause severe early-onset obesity that can be mitigated by administering leptin. However, the role of genetic regulation of leptin in polygenic obesity remains poorly understood. We performed an exome-based analysis in up to 57,232 individuals of diverse ancestries to identify genetic variants that influence adiposity-adjusted leptin concentrations. We identify five novel variants, including four missense variants, in LEP, ZNF800, KLHL31, and ACTL9, and one intergenic variant near KLF14. The missense variant Val94Met (rs17151919) in LEP was common in individuals of African ancestry only, and its association with lower leptin concentrations was specific to this ancestry (P = 2 x 10(-16), n = 3,901). Using in vitro analyses, we show that the Met94 allele decreases leptin secretion. We also show that the Met94 allele is associated with higher BMI in young African-ancestry children but not in adults, suggesting that leptin regulates early adiposity.",,Endocrinology & Metabolism

Individuals aged 65 years and over qualify for the program and receive a personal invitation for a free flu shot, while ineligible individuals have to pay out-of-pocket and face additional barriers to getting vaccinated. The quasi-random variation at age 65 is exploited to analyse program impact on vaccination behavior of cohabiting partners and adult children. We find that the program induced a 10 percentage points increase in vaccination coverage among individuals at age 65. The program further led to a similar effect on vaccination take-up by cohabiting younger partners, but spillovers on children were negative. These asymmetric patterns of vaccination uptake are consistent with partners and children learning about influenza mortality risk, target group membership, and cost and benefits of vaccination, as well as salience. We conclude that public health campaigns should pay attention to the effects on voluntary preventive care participation as within-family spillovers impact the program's overall public health impact.

A Discrete Choice Experiment,"Background and Objective Non-participation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening needs to be decreased to achieve its full potential as a public health strategy. To facilitate successful implementation of CRC screening towards unscreened individuals, this study aimed to quantify the impact of screening and individual characteristics on non-participation in CRC screening. Methods An online discrete choice experiment partly based on qualitative research was used among 406 representatives of the Dutch general population aged 55-75 years. In the discrete choice experiment, respondents were offered a series of choices between CRC screening scenarios that differed on five characteristics: effectiveness of the faecal immunochemical screening test, risk of a false-negative outcome, test frequency, waiting time for faecal immunochemical screening test results and waiting time for a colonoscopy follow-up test. The discrete choice experiment data were analysed in a systematic manner using random-utility-maximisation choice processes with scale and/or preference heterogeneity (based on 15 individual characteristics) and/or random intercepts. Results Screening characteristics proved to influence non-participation in CRC screening (21.7-28.0% non-participation rate), but an individual's characteristics had an even higher impact on CRC screening non-participation (8.4-75.5% non-participation rate); particularly the individual's attitude towards CRC screening followed by whether the individual had participated in a cancer screening programme before, the decision style of the individual and the educational level of the individual. Our findings provided a high degree of confidence in the internal-external validity. Conclusions This study showed that although screening characteristics proved to influence non-participation in CRC screening, a respondent's characteristics had a much higher impact on CRC screening non-participation.

Utilizing 'soft signals' in the regulation of patient safety","Modern healthcare systems are highly data- and evidence-driven. The use of indicators and other performance management devices, introduced by healthcare leaders and regulators to monitor performance and address patient safety matters, are just two examples. Research has shown that the wish to manage and address risks via measuring practices does not always do justice to the complexities of healthcare organization and delivery, for (patient) safety and quality are not only about measurable things. So, while recognized as valuable, there are calls that hard metrics must be supplemented with soft signals - generally known as qualitative or informal data - to gain a better representation of actual performance and tackle safety issues. With the aim to contribute to the theoretical notion that a dialogical approach to knowledge and information-management is a fruitful way to manage and address risks and problems in healthcare, this paper addresses the research question 'What role do soft signals play in the assessment of patient safety risks and how are these signals employed in everyday regulatory practices?' We draw from qualitative interviews, observations and document analyses in a multi-year (2015-2019) research project to show that soft signals are vital to everyday regulatory practices, as they provide context to 'hard' signals and help to make sense of and weigh risks. Based on these findings we encourage policy makers and regulatory bodies to start an active dialogue on their use of soft signals and develop work models and working routines for discussing them as well as their implications.",Sensemaking,Operations Research & Management Science

By intervening on these quality differences, patient outcomes may be improved. However, whether observed differences in outcome reflect the true quality improvement potential is not known for many diseases. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the effect of differences in performance on structure and processes of care, and case-mix on between-center differences in outcome after endovascular treatment (EVT) for ischemic stroke.MethodsIn this observational cohort study, ischemic stroke patients who received EVT between 2014 and 2017 in all 17 Dutch EVT-centers were included. Primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death), at 90days. We used random effect proportional odds regression modelling, to analyze the effect of differences in structure indicators (center volume and year of admission), process indicators (time to treatment and use of general anesthesia) and case-mix, by tracking changes in tau(2), which represents the amount of between-center variation in outcome.ResultsThree thousand two hundred seventy-nine patients were included. Performance on structure and process indicators varied significantly between EVT-centers (P<0.001). Predicted probability of good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-2 at 90days), which can be interpreted as an overall measure of a center's case-mix, varied significantly between 17 and 50% across centers. The amount of between-center variation (tau(2)) was estimated at 0.040 in a model only accounting for random variation. This estimate more than doubled after adding case-mix variables (tau(2): 0.086) to the model, while a small amount of between-center variation was explained by variation in performance on structure and process indicators (tau(2): 0.081 and 0.089, respectively). This indicates that variation in case-mix affects the differences in outcome to a much larger extent.ConclusionsBetween-center variation in outcome of ischemic stroke patients mostly reflects differences in case-mix, rather than differences in structure or process of care. Since the latter two capture the real quality improvement potential, these should be used as indicators for comparing center performance. Especially when a strong association exists between those indicators and outcome, as is the case for time to treatment in ischemic stroke.",Process of care,Health Care Sciences & Services

Results are contrasted to age-matched actual population health scores and to findings from a previous study in The Netherlands. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was performed. The same survey questions were applied as in a previous study in The Netherlands in order to enable inter-country comparisons. The descriptive system of the EQ-5D-3L health status questionnaire was used to assess the acceptability of moderate and severe health problems at ages from 30 to 80 by 10-year age-groups. Descriptive statistics were performed and linear regression analysis was used to investigate the determinants of acceptability. Results Altogether 9281 (female 32.8%) were involved with mean age 36.0 years and EQ-5D-3L index score of 0.852 (SD 0.177). Acceptability of health problems increased with age, differed per health domain and with severity of the problems. Except for 'Self-care', moderate health problems were acceptable by the majority from age 70 and acceptability scores were lower than EQ-5D-3L population norms from that age. The lowest average acceptability age was found in the 'Anxiety/depression' and dimension the highest in the 'Self-care' dimension. Respondents' age, current health, and lifestyle were significant determinants (R-2: 0.041-0.130). With a few minor exceptions in some health dimensions, acceptability levels and patterns were strikingly similar to the Dutch findings.

The aim of this study was to assess the construct validity of the CarerQol in the Hungarian context. Methods The CarerQol was translated into Hungarian. Subsequently, in a cross-sectional online survey, representative for the general Hungarian population (N = 1000), informal caregivers were identified (N = 149, female 51.2%, mean age 53.2). Clinical, convergent and discriminant validity of the CarerQol were evaluated in relation to the caregivers' and care recipients' EQ-5D-5L health status, and caregiving situation characteristics. Results Average CarerQol-7D and CarerQol-VAS scores were 76.0 (SD 16.2) and 6.8 (SD 2.3), respectively. CarerQol-7D and CarerQol-VAS scores were significantly correlated with caregiving time (r = - 0.257; - 0.212), caregivers' EQ-5D-5L scores (r = 0.453; 0.326) and the CarerQol-7D also with care recipients' EQ-5D-5L scores (r = 0.247). CarerQol-7D scores differed significantly with relevant caregiving characteristics (e.g. nature and severity of care recipients' health status, sharing household) and both the CarerQol-7D and CarerQol-VAS with the overall care experience. Conclusion Our findings confirmed the validity of the Hungarian language version of the CarerQol and support the cross-cultural validity of the instrument. CarerQol-7D scores performed better in distinguishing caregiving situation characteristics than the general happiness measure CarerQol-VAS. Care recipients' health status was only weakly associated with informal caregivers' care-related quality of life and happiness. Caregivers' own health and caregiving circumstances were more strongly associated with these scores.",EQ-5D-5L,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

A retrospective assessment of 71 patients was performed on platinum use in the Netherlands. Genetically unselected patients yielded low response rates. For a predefined subanalysis of all patients with comprehensive next-generation sequencing, 30 patients were grouped based on the presence of pathogenic aberrations in genes associated with DNA damage repair (DDR) or aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC). Fourteen patients (47%) were DDR deficient (DDRd), of which seven with inactivatedBRCA2(BRCA2mut). Six patients classified as AVPC. DDRd patients showed beneficial biochemical response to carboplatin, largely driven by all BRCA2mut patients having >50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline and objective radiographic response. In the wild-typeBRCA2subgroup, 35% had a >50% PSA decline (P= .006) and 16% radiographic response (P < .001). Median overall survival was 21 months for BRCA2mut patients vs 7 months (P= .041) for those with functionalBRCA2. AVPC patients demonstrated comparable responses to non-AVPC, including a similar overall survival, despite the poor prognosis for this subgroup. In the scope of the registration of poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for mCRPC, we provide initial insights on cross-resistance between PARPi and platinum compounds. By combining the literature and our study, we identified 18 patients who received both agents. In this cohort, only BRCA2mut patients treated with platinum first (n = 4), responded to both agents. We confirm thatBRCA2inactivation is associated with meaningful responses to carboplatin, suggesting a role for both PARPi and platinum-based chemotherapy in preselected mCRPC patients.",metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer,Oncology

For introverts, measure stringency has a negative effect on depressive symptoms, while for extraverts, it has a positive, but non-significant effect on depressive symptoms.

Our systematic search rendered 3,945 unique hits and findings of 187 studies were integrated in our analyses. Results hereof suggest that holding of both insurance products is systematically impeded by substitution by social security, adverse selection, nonstandard preferences and limited rationality due to low financial literacy and risk unawareness.

Researchers extensively studied the psychometric qualities of resulting ratings. However, these studies rarely consider the number of response categories and its consequences for residents' ratings of faculty's teaching performance. We compared the variability of residents' ratings measured by five- and seven-point response scales. Methods This retrospective study used teaching performance data from Dutch anaesthesiology residency training programs. Questionnaires with five- and seven-point response scales from the extensively studied System for Evaluation of Teaching Qualities (SETQ) collected the ratings. We inspected ratings' variability by comparing standard deviations, interquartile ranges, and frequency (percentage) distributions. Relevant statistical tests were used to test differences in frequency distributions and teaching performance scores. Results We examined 3379 residents' ratings and 480 aggregated faculty scores. Residents used the additional response categories provided by the seven-point scale - especially those differentiating between positive performances. Residents' ratings and aggregated faculty scores showed a more even distribution on the seven-point scale compared to the five-point scale. Also, the seven-point scale showed a smaller ceiling effect. After rescaling, the mean scores and (most) standard deviations of ratings from both scales were comparable.

The aim of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) compared with DPP-4 inhibitors when added to metformin and sulfonylurea in people with type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands. Methods A cost-utility analysis is performed using the Cardiff diabetes model, a fixed-time increment stochastic simulation model informed by 'United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 68' risk equations. The base-case analysis uses a 40-year time horizon, a Dutch societal perspective and differential discounting (4% for costs, 1.5% for effects). Inputs are obtained from the literature and Dutch price lists. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis are performed. Results Dapagliflozin is dominant compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, resulting in a euro990 cost saving and a 0.28 quality-adjusted life year gain over 40 years. Cost savings are associated mainly with treatment costs and a reduced incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications, among others nephropathy, myocardial infarction and stroke. Results are robust to changes in input parameters. Conclusions Dapagliflozin is a cost-saving alternative to DPP-4 inhibitors when added to metformin and sulfonylurea. The incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications is lower for people treated with dapagliflozin. Uncertainty around this outcome is low.",,Endocrinology & Metabolism

Method In this multiple case study, the present authors collected and qualitatively analysed data (organizational documents, meetings records and focus group reports) on organizational changes made in two specialized Dutch disability service organizations, using ecological theory as a sensitizing framework and the constant comparative method. Results Themes describing organizational changes in this context were as follows: a messy start to the transition; staff, professionals and managers remain at a distance; staff members' ability to change; clear boundaries between formal and informal caregivers; and staff's feelings of being unheard. Conclusions Organizational changes can enhance, but also limit, the quality of residential support services provided to people with intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviours. The change process and impact of organizational changes on residents must be examined closely.",organizational change,Rehabilitation

The assessment of the monetary value of gains in this broader quality of life is needed to use these measurements in a cost-effectiveness framework. Methods We applied the well-being valuation approach to calculate a first monetary value for capability well-being in comparison to health, derived by ICECAP-A and EQ-5D-5L, respectively. Data from an online survey administered in February 2018 to a representative sample of UK citizens aged 18-65 was used (N = 1512). To overcome the endogeneity of income, we applied an instrumental variable regression. Several alternative model specifications were calculated to test the robustness of the results. Results The base case empirical estimate for the implied monetary value of a year in full capability well-being was 66,597 pound. The estimate of the monetary value of a QALY, obtained from the same sample and using the same methodology amounted to 30,786 pound, which compares well to previous estimates from the willingness to pay literature. Throughout the conducted robustness checks, the value of capability well-being was found to be between 1.7 and 2.6 times larger than the value of health. Conclusion While the applied approach is not without limitations, the generated insights, especially concerning the relative magnitude of valuations, may be useful for decision-makers having to decide based on economic evaluations using the ICECAP-A measure or, to a lesser extent, other (capability) well-being outcome measures.",Well-being valuation,Health Care Sciences & Services

This is evident within academic publications, and mirrored in fragmented and diversified implementation efforts, both within and across countries.MethodThis article builds on discourse analysis in order to map the ambiguity surrounding VBHC. We conducted a document analysis of publicly accessible, official publications (n =22) by actors and organizations that monitor and influence the quality of care in the Netherlands. Additionally, between March and July 2019, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews (n =23) with national stakeholders.ResultsOur research revealed four discourses, each with their own perception regarding the main purpose of VBHC. Firstly, we identified a Patient Empowerment discourse in which VBHC is a framework for strengthening the position of patients regarding their medical decisions. Secondly, in the Governance discourse, VBHC is a toolkit to incentivize providers. Thirdly, within the Professionalism discourse, VBHC is a methodology for healthcare delivery. Fourthly, in the Critique discourse, VBHC is rebuked as a dogma of manufacturability. We also show, however, that these diverging lines of reasoning find common ground: they perceive shared decision-making to be a key component of VBHC. Strikingly, this common perception contrasts with the pioneering literature on VBHC.ConclusionsThe four discourses will profoundly shape the diverse manners in which VBHC moves from an abstract concept to the practical provision and administration of health care. Moreover, our study reveals that VBHC's conceptual ambiguity largely arises from differing and often deeply rooted presuppositions, which underlie these discourses, and which frame different perceptions on value in health care. The meaning of VBHC - including its perceived implications for action - thus depends greatly on the frame of reference an actor or organization brings to bear as they aim for more value for patients. Recognizing this is a vital concern when studying, implementing and evaluating VBHC.",Netherlands,Health Care Sciences & Services

Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide (Len-Mt) extends survival and delays relapse and the subsequent initiation of costly second-line regimens. Here, we report the cost-effectiveness of Len-Mt following ASCT from a Dutch healthcare service perspective. Methods A partitioned survival model was developed to assess the lifetime costs and benefits for patients with NDMM. Efficacy was taken from a pooled meta-analysis of clinical trial data. Costs and subsequent therapy data were taken from sources appropriate for the Dutch market. Results Lenalidomide produced a quality-adjusted life year gain of 2.46 and a life year gain of 2.79 vs no maintenance treatment. The cost of lenalidomide was partially offset by savings of EUR 77 462 in subsequent treatment costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Len-Mt vs no maintenance treatment was EUR 30 143. Key model drivers included subsequent therapies, dosing schedule, and time horizon. Conclusion Lenalidomide is cost-effective after ASCT vs no maintenance therapy in the Netherlands. By extending PFS, lenalidomide delays the cost burdens associated with relapse and subsequent treatment lines.",multiple myeloma,Hematology

Even the most sophisticated RA models, however, tend to undercompensate (overcompensate) insurers for people in poor (good) health. One reason RA models are imperfect is that some predictors cannot serve as risk adjustor because they are not available for theentirepopulation. This paper applies an indirect method to exploit such predictive information: constrained regression. Our focus is on the Netherlands where morbidity data from general practitioners (GPs) are available for only around 10 percent of the population. We combine thisincompletesample withcompletedata (N=16.7million) on spending and risk adjustors. In a first step, we find that GP morbidity data are predictivenet ofthe Dutch RA model. In a second step, we use the GP morbidity data to impose constraints on the coefficients of the RA model. This results in more RA funds being sent to undercompensated groups. Using a split-sample approach, we simulate two constrained regression models and compare the outcomes to those of an unconstrained model. Our findings indicate that constrained regression can be a useful tool to exploit predictive information that is available for only a sample of the population.",constrained regression,Health Care Sciences & Services

Such housing bridges the gap between the extremes of living in an institutionalised setting and remaining in their own house. The demand is related to the closure of many residential care homes and the need for social engagement with other residents. This study focuses on housing initiatives that offer innovative and alternative forms of independent living, which deviate from mainstream housing arrangements. It draws on recent literature on healthcare 'rebels' and further develops the concept of 'rebellion' in the context of housing. The main research question is how founders dealt with challenges of establishing and governing 'rebellious' innovative living arrangements for older people in the highly regulated context of housing and care in the Netherlands. Qualitative in-depth interviews with 17 founders (social entrepreneurs, directors and supervisory board members) were conducted. Founders encountered various obstacles that are often related to governmental and sectoral rules and regulations. Their stories demonstrate the opportunities and constraints of innovative entrepreneurship at the intersection of housing and care. The study concludes with the notion of 'responsible rebellion' and practical lessons about dealing with rules and regulations and creating supportive contexts.",law,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

A high (low) residual spender is someone for whom the residual-spending less payment (from premiums and risk adjustment)-is high (low), indicating that the person is highly underpaid (overpaid). We begin with descriptive analysis of the top and bottom 1% and 0.1% of residuals building to address the question of the degree of persistence in membership at the extremes. Common findings emerge among the countries. First, the diseases found among those with the highest residual spending are also disproportionately found among those with the lowest residual spending. Second, those at the top of the residual spending distribution (where spending exceeds payments the most) account for a massively high share of the unexplained variance in the predictions from the risk adjustment model. Third, in terms of persistence, we find that membership in the extremes of the residual spending distribution is highly persistent, raising concerns about selection-related incentives targeting these individuals. As our results show, the one-in-a-thousand people (on both sides of the residual distribution) play an outsized role in creating adverse incentives associated with health plan payment systems. In response to the observed importance of the extremes of the residual spending distribution, we propose an innovative combination of risk-pooling and reinsurance targeting the predictively undercompensated group. In all three countries, this form of risk sharing substantially improves the overall fit of payments to spending. Perhaps surprisingly, by reducing the burden on diagnostic indicators to predict high payments, our proposed risk sharing policy reduces the gap between payments and spending not only for the most undercompensated individuals but also for the most overcompensated people.",Risk sharing,Health Care Sciences & Services

Matching demand and services for chronic care is not easy as patients may have different needs in different stages of the disease. More insight is needed into the complete patient journey to do justice to the services required in each stage of the disease, to the different experiences of patients in each part of the journey, and to outcomes in each stage. With patient journey we refer to the ""journey"" of the patient along the services received within a demand segment of chronic care. We developed a generic framework for describing patient journeys and provider networks, based on an extension of the well-known model of Donabedian, to relate demand, services, resources, behavior, and outcomes. We also developed a generic operational model for the detailed modeling of services and resources, allowing for insight into costs. The generic operational model can be tailored to the specific characteristics of patient groups. We applied this modeling approach to type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Diabetes care is a form of chronic care for patients suffering diabetes mellitus. We studied the performance of T2D networks, using a descriptive model template. To identify and describe demand we made use of the following demand segments within the diabetes type 2 population: patients targeted for prevention; patients with stage 1 diabetes treated by their GP with lifestyle advice; patients with diabetes stage 2 treated by their GP with lifestyle advice and oral medication; patients with stage 3 diabetes treated by their GP with lifestyle advice, oral medication, and insulin injections; patients with stage 4 diabetes with complications (treated by internal medicine specialists). We used a Markov model to describe the transitions between the different health states. The model enables the patient journey through the health care system for cohorts of newly diagnosed T2D patients to be described, and to make a projection of the resource requirements of the different demand segments over the years. We illustrate our approach with a case study on a T2D care network in The Netherlands and reflect on the role of demand segmentation to analyse the case study results, with the objective of improving the T2D service delivery.",generic framework,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Therefore, patients should attend their primary diabetes care providers whenever a visit is necessary. Parameters that might affect whether this condition is fulfilled include accessibility (in terms of travel distance and travel time to the practice), as well as aspects of service quality (for example in-practice waiting time and quality of the provider's communication with the patient). The relationships of these variables with the frequency of visits to the primary diabetes care provider are investigated.MethodsThe investigation is performed with questionnaire data of 1086 type 2 diabetes patients from study regions in England (213), Finland (135), Germany (218), Greece (153), the Netherlands (296) and Spain (71). Data were collected between October 2011 and March 2012. Data were analysed using log-linear Poisson regression models with self-reported numbers of visits in a year to the primary diabetes care provider as the criterion variable. Predictor variables of the core model were: country; gender; age; education; stage of diabetes; heart problems; previous stroke; problems with lower extremities; problems with sight; kidney problems; travel distance and travel time; in-practice waiting time; and quality of communication. To test region-specific characteristics, the interaction between the latter four predictor variables and study region was also investigated.ResultsWhen study regions are merged, travel distance and in-practice waiting time have a negative effect, travel time no effect and quality of communication a positive effect on visit frequency (with the latter effect being by far largest). When region specific effects are considered, there are strong interaction effects shown for travel distance, in-practice waiting time and quality of communication. For travel distance, as well as for in-practice waiting time, there are region-specific effects in opposite directions. For quality of communication, there are only differences in the strength with which visit frequency increases with this variable.ConclusionsThe impact of quality of communication on visit frequency is the largest and is stable across all study regions. Hence, increasing quality of communication seems to be the best approach for increasing visit frequency.",Type 2 diabetes,Health Care Sciences & Services

With China's ageing population and increased prevalence of people with chronic diseases, the improvement of unhealthy behaviours in this population has become crucial. Although recent studies have highlighted the importance of social participation for health and quality of life (QoL) among older people, no study to date has included social participation along with more traditional health behaviours. Therefore, this study aimed to identify associations of multiple health behaviours (social participation, physical activity, maintenance of a healthy diet and not smoking) with health and QoL outcomes (including cognitive and physical function) among chronically ill older adults in China. Methods For this nationally representative cross-sectional study, wave 1 data from the World Health Organization's Study on global AGEing and adult health (China) were examined. In total, 6629 community-dwelling older adults (mean age, 64.9 years) with at least one chronic disease were included. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to evaluate associations of health behaviours with health and QoL outcomes while controlling for background characteristics. Results Greater social participation was associated with better QoL [beta = 0.127, standard error (SE) = 0.002,p < 0.001], cognitive function (beta = 0.154, SE = 0.033,p < 0.001) and physical function (beta = - 0.102, SE = 0.008,p < 0.001).

Sufficient fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with better QoL (beta = 0.087, SE = 0.015,p < 0.001). Conclusions Our findings suggest that social participation is an important health behaviour for quality of life and cognitive function among chronically ill older people in China.

Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are promising tools to decrease such errors by improving prescription quality in terms of lab values. However, alert fatigue counteracts their impact. We aimed to develop a novel user-friendly, evidence-based, clinical context-aware CDSS to alert nephrologists about DLIs clinically important lab values in prescriptions of kidney recipients. Methods For the most frequently prescribed medications identified by a prospective cross-sectional study in a kidney transplant clinic, DLI-rules were extracted using main pharmacology references and clinical inputs from clinicians. A CDSS was then developed linking a computerized prescription system and lab records. The system performance was tested using data of both fictitious and real patients. The ""Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction"" was used to measure user satisfaction of the human-computer interface. Results Among 27 study medications, 17 needed adjustments regarding renal function, 15 required considerations based on hepatic function, 8 had drug-pregnancy interactions, and 13 required baselines or follow-up lab monitoring. Using IF & THEN rules and the contents of associated alert, a DLI-alerting CDSS was designed. To avoid alert fatigue, the alert appearance was considered as interruptive only when medications with serious risks were contraindicated or needed to be discontinued or adjusted. Other alerts appeared in a non-interruptive mode with visual clues on the prescription window for easy, intuitive notice. When the system was used for real 100 patients, it correctly detected 260 DLIs and displayed 249 monitoring, seven hepatic, four pregnancy, and none renal alerts. The system delivered patient-specific recommendations based on individual lab values in real-time. Clinicians were highly satisfied with the usability of the system. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study of a comprehensive DLI-CDSS for kidney transplant care. By alerting on considerations in renal and hepatic dysfunctions, maternal and fetal toxicity, or required lab monitoring, this system can potentially improve medication safety in kidney recipients.

Clinical pharmacists integrated in primary care teams might improve quality of pharmaceutical care.ObjectiveTo assess the effect of non-dispensing clinical pharmacists integrated in primary care teams on general practitioners' prescribing quality.SettingThis study was conducted in 25 primary care practices in the Netherlands.MethodsNon-randomised, controlled, multi-centre, complex intervention study with pre-post comparison. First, we identified potential prescribing quality indicators from the literature and assessed their feasibility, validity, acceptability, reliability and sensitivity to change. Also, an expert panel assessed the indicators' health impact. Next, using the final set of indicators, we measured the quality of prescribing in practices where non-dispensing pharmacists were integrated in the team (intervention group) compared to usual care (two control groups). Data were extracted anonymously from the healthcare records. Comparisons were made using mixed models correcting for potential confounders.Main outcome measureQuality of prescribing, measured with prescribing quality indicators.ResultsOf 388 eligible indicators reported in the literature we selected 8. In addition, two more indicators relevant for Dutch general practice were formulated by an expert panel. Scores on all 10 indicators improved in the intervention group after introduction of the non-dispensing pharmacist. However, when compared to control groups, prescribing quality improved solely on the indicator measuring monitoring of the renal function in patients using antihypertensive medication: relative risk of a monitored renal function in the intervention group compared to usual care: 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.05, p-value 0.010) and compared to usual care plus: 1.04 (1.01-1.06, p-value 0.004).ConclusionThis study did not demonstrate a consistent effect of the introduction of non-dispensing clinical pharmacists in the primary care team on the quality of physician's prescribing.

This study had the goal of determining the impact of nonfatal hospitalisations on the quality of life of a cohort of patients previously diagnosed with heart failure by using their quality of life measurements before and after hospitalisation.MethodsThe impact of hospitalisation on health-related quality of life was estimated by calculating the difference in utility measured using the EQ-5D-3L in patients that were hospitalised and had records of utility before and after hospitalisation. The variation in differences between the utilities pre and post hospitalisation was explained through two multiple linear regression models using (1) the individual patient characteristics and (2) the hospitalisation characteristics as explanatory variables.ResultsThe mean difference between health-related quality of life measurement pre and post hospitalisation was found to be 0.020 [95% CI: -0.020, 0.059] when measured with the EQ-5D index, while there was a mean decrease of -0.012 [95% CI: -0.043, 0.020] in the utility measured with the visual analogue scale. Differences in utility variation according to the primary cause for hospitalisation were found. Regression models showed a statistically significant impact of body mass index and serum creatinine in the index utility differences and of serum creatinine for utilities measured with the visual analogue scale.ConclusionsKnowing the impact of hospitalisation on health-related quality of life is particularly relevant for informing cost-effectiveness studies designed to assess health technologies aimed at reducing hospital admissions. Through using patient-level data it was possible to estimate the variation in utilities before and after the average hospitalisation and for hospitalisations due to the most common causes for hospital admission. These estimates for (dis) utility could be used in the calculations of effectiveness on economic evaluations, especially when discrete event simulations are the employed modelling technique.",Heart failure,Health Care Sciences & Services

It has been suggested that TTO yields more accurate health state valuations, because TTO is subject to both upward and downward biases that may cancel out. Verifying this claim, however, would require a golden standard to test validity against. In this study, we attempted to provide a first direct test of the validity of health state valuation. A total of 119 students completed five TTO and SG tasks. Afterwards, their health state valuations elicited with TTO and SG were shown to them in an interactive graph. Respondents were asked to indicate which of the methods represented their valuation of a health state best. They could also adjust their valuation. Overall, we found that respondents indicated that TTO valuations better reflected health state valuations, a result that was more pronounced for more severe health states. When offered the opportunity, on average, respondents adjusted health state valuations downwards.

The newly developed Well-being of Older People measure (WOOP) aims to capture all aspects that older people find important to their well-being. This study explores the validity and test-retest reliability of the WOOP. Between December 2017 and January 2018, an online survey was used to retrieve data from 1113 people aged 65 years and older in the Netherlands. Regression analyses on Cantril's Ladder scores were conducted to explore the relative importance of the items of the WOOP. Dimensionality was checked using exploratory factor analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity were investigated by relating the WOOP to several measures of health and well-being. Test-retest reliability was examined using data from 269 respondents that participated in a second online survey, distributed one week after the first. The items of the WOOP were significantly associated with Cantril's Ladder scores. When regressed simultaneously this was still true for all but the 'social contacts' item and one level of the 'acceptance and resilience' item. The dimensionality analysis revealed three factors, of which two included items of the WOOP and the EQ-5D-5L and the third only items of the WOOP. The WOOP correlated moderately to highly with physical health, and (very) highly with (mental) health and well-being measures. The test-retest reliability in terms of ICC was high, whereas the kappa for the items was fair to good, except for two items. Overall, the WOOP seems to capture aspects relevant to the well-being of older people adequately, and the results of first validity and reliability tests were satisfactory. Before the WOOP can be used in economic evaluations, further validation in a variety of health and social care settings is recommended, and utility weights need to be determined.",The Netherlands,Biomedical Social Sciences

A micro -costing study comparing healthcare and societal costs of hospital -based and home -based subcutaneous administration of trastuzumab,"Objective: To investigate resource use and time investments of healthcare professionals, patients and their family and to compare healthcare and societal costs of one single hospital-based and one single home-based subcutaneous administration of trastuzumab in The Netherlands. Method: We conducted a bottom-up micro-costing study. Patients diagnosed with HER2+ early or metastatic breast cancer were recruited in four Dutch hospitals. For healthcare costs, data were collected on drug use, consumables, use of healthcare facilities, time of healthcare professionals, and travelling distance of the nurse. For societal costs, data were collected on patient and family costs (including travelling expenses and time of informal caregivers) and productivity losses of paid and unpaid work. Results: Societal costs of one single administration of SC trastuzumab were (sic)1753 within the home- based and (sic)1724 within the hospital-based setting. Drug costs of trastuzumab were identical in both settings ((sic)1651). Healthcare costs were higher for home-based administration ((sic)91 versus (sic)47) mainly because of more time of healthcare professionals (110 versus 38 minutes). Costs for patient and family were, however, lower for home-based administration due to travelling expenses ((sic)7 versus (sic)0) and time of informal caregivers ((sic)14 versus (sic)4). Costs for productivity losses were similar for both settings. Conclusions: Home-based subcutaneous administration of trastuzumab is more time consuming for healthcare professionals and therefore more costly than hospital-based administration. The total budget impact can be large considering that a large number of patients receive a large number of cycles of oncology treatments. If home-based administration is the way forward, novel approaches are crucial for ensuring ef ficiency of home-based care. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical evidence from the Netherlands,"Background: In market-based systems, the possibility to switch is an important precondition for a well-functioning health insurance market. To assess whether such a market works as intended, insight into the considerations and perceived barriers of insured is needed. This study examines the rates and reasons for not switching health insurer in the Netherlands, and whether these reasons differ between the general population and the population of people with a chronic illness. Methods: We made use of survey data collected in 2017 among two panels representing the general population (n = 659, response 44%) and the chronically ill population (n = 1593, response 86%). Results: We found differences regarding the reasons for not switching insurer. The chronically ill population seems to attach more importance to reasons related to the coverage of the health plan, whereas the general population is more focused on the level of service. Some people who considered switching experienced barriers, however, these barriers were not significantly more experienced by the chronically ill population. Conclusions: This study reveals differences between the general population and the chronically ill population when examining reasons for not switching related to quality and coverage. A subset from the people who initially considered to switch experienced barriers which might have altered their decision. Further research is recommended to include questions about information search behaviour to examine which consumers make an informed decision for not switching, and for whom barriers limit switching.",,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Many new cancer medicines have been developed that can improve patients' outcomes. However, access to these agents comes later in Europe than in the United States (US). The aim of this study is to assess the access in Europe to newly registered cancer drugs and to get more insight in the implications of these variations for patients. Methods. A retrospective database study was conducted. Analyses involved 12 cancer drugs and 28 European countries in the period 2011-2018. Time to patient access, speed of drug uptake, and the potential loss of life years due to a delay in access have been studied. Results. Marketing approval for the cancer drugs came on average 242 days later in Europe than in the US, and actual patient access varied extensively across Europe. The average time to market in Europe was 403 days (range 17-1187 days). The delay in patient access of ipilimumab and abiraterone may have led to a potential loss of more than 30,000 life years.

In this article, we study how the Dutch IRS contributed to social and participative learning from incidents. We integrate quantitative and qualitative data in a mixed-methods design. Between 1 July 2013 and 31 March 2019, Dutch hospitals reported and investigated 4667 incidents. Healthcare inspectors scored all investigations to assess hospitals' learning process following incidents. We analysed if and on what aspects hospitals improved over time. Additionally, we draw from semi-structured interviews with incident investigators, quality managers, healthcare inspectors and healthcare professionals. Healthcare inspectors score incident investigation reports better over time, suggesting that hospitals conduct better investigations or have become adept at writing reports in line with inspectors' expectations. Our qualitative data suggests the IRS contributed to practices that support social and participative learning-the professionalisation of incident investigation teams, the increased involvement of patients and families in investigations-and practices that do not-not linking learning from the investigation teams to that of professionals, not consistently monitoring the recommendations that investigations identify. The IRS both hits and misses the mark. We learned that IRSs need to be responsive to the (developing) capabilities of healthcare providers to investigate and learn from incidents, if the IRS is to stimulate social and participative learning from incidents.

The literature on these initiatives seems to either downplay or overemphasize epistemic differences between the fields. In this paper, we study the convergence and divergence of the epistemic cultures of data science and psychiatry. This approach is more likely to capture where and how the cultures differ and gives insights into how practitioners from both fields find ways to work together despite their differences. We introduce the notions of ""epistemic virtues"" to focus on epistemic differences ethnographically, and ""trading zones"" to concentrate on how differences are negotiated. This leads us to the following research question: how are epistemic differences negotiated by data science and psychiatry practitioners in a hospital-based data-driven initiative? Our results are based on an ethnographic study in which we observed a Dutch psychiatric hospital department developing prediction models of patient outcomes based on machine learning techniques (September 2017 - February 2018). Many epistemic virtues needed to be negotiated, such as completeness or selectivity in data inclusion. These differences were traded locally and temporarily, stimulated by shared epistemic virtues (such as a systematic approach), boundary objects and socialization processes. Trading became difficult when virtues were too diverse, differences were enlarged by storytelling and parties did not have the time or capacity to learn about the other. In the discussion, we argue that our combined theoretical framework offers a fresh way to study how cooperation between diverse practitioners goes and where it can be improved. We make a call for bringing epistemic differences into the open as this makes a grounded discussion possible about the added value of data-driven initiatives and the role they can play in healthcare.",Ethnography,Biomedical Social Sciences

Quality indicators (QIs) can provide this insight. This study aims to find consensus among participants regarding QIs for healthcare for people with DS. Methods We conducted a four-round Delphi study, in which 33 healthcare professionals involved in healthcare for people with DS and two patient organisations' representatives in the Netherlands participated. Median and 75-percentiles were used to determine consensus among the answers on 5-point Likert-scales. In each round, participants received an overview of participants' answers from the previous round. Results Participants agreed (consensus was achieved) that a QI-set should provide insight into available healthcare, enable healthcare improvements, and cover a large diversity of quality domains and healthcare disciplines. However, the number of QIs in the set should be limited in order to prevent registration burden. Participants were concerned that QIs would make quality information about individual healthcare professionals publicly available, which would induce judgement of healthcare professionals and harm quality, instead of improving it. Conclusions We unravelled the complexity of capturing healthcare for people with DS in a QI-set. Patients' rights to relevant information have to be carefully balanced against providers' entitlement to a safe environment in which they can learn and improve. A QI-set should be tailored to different healthcare disciplines and information systems, and measurement instruments should be suitable for collecting information from people with DS.

We evaluated the performance of available algorithms for QLQ-C30 conversion into EQ-5D-3L based utilities in a metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patient population and subsequently developed a mCRC specific algorithm. Influence of mapping on cost-effectiveness was evaluated.MethodsThree available algorithms were compared with observed utilities from the CAIRO3 study. Six models were developed using 5-fold cross-validation: predicting EQ-5D-3L tariffs from QLQ-C30 functional scale scores, continuous QLQ-C30 scores or dummy levels with a random effects model (RE), a most likely probability method on EQ-5D-3L functional scale scores, a beta regression model on QLQ-C30 functional scale scores and a separate equations subgroup approach on QLQ-C30 functional scale scores. Performance was assessed, and algorithms were tested on incomplete QLQ-C30 questionnaires. Influence of utility mapping on incremental cost/QALY gained (ICER) was evaluated in an existing Dutch mCRC cost-effectiveness model.ResultsThe available algorithms yielded mean utilities of 1: 0.87sd:0.14,2: 0.81 +/- 0.15 (both Dutch tariff) and 3: 0.81 +/- sd:0.19. Algorithm 1 and 3 were significantly different from the mean observed utility (0.83 +/- 0.17 with Dutch tariff, 0.80 +/- 0.20 with U.K. tariff). All new models yielded predicted utilities drawing close to observed utilities; differences were not statistically significant. The existing algorithms resulted in an ICER difference of Euro10,140 less and Euro1765 more compared to the observed EQ-5D-3L based ICER (Euro168,048). The preferred newly developed algorithm was Euro5094 higher than the observed EQ-5D-3L based ICER. Disparity was explained by minimal diffences in incremental QALYs between models.Conclusion p id=Par Available mapping algorithms sufficiently accurately predict utilities. With the commonly used statistical methods, we did not succeed in developping an improved mapping algorithm. Importantly, cost-effectiveness outcomes in this study were comparable to the original model outcomes between different mapping algorithms.

Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children with sickle cell disease treated in a comprehensive care centre from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016. Health care utilisation of included patients was based upon data from two main sources. The clinical practice guideline was used to determine the expected resource use of routine comprehensive care (planned elective care), and the financial claims database was used to estimate real-world resource use associated with acute and inpatient care (additional care). Results A total of 125 children with sickle cell disease were analysed. Expenditures for these patients averaged euro5049 [standard deviation (SD) euro1634] per child per year. Total yearly costs per patient varied considerably, ranging from euro669 to euro84 010, and less than 15% of patients were responsible for 50% of the health care costs. The majority (37%) of costs was associated with inpatient hospital care, which increased by age group, 27% with diagnostics, 19% with treatment, 11% with outpatients' visits and 6% with emergency care. Conclusion We have described real-world resource use and expenditures for children with sickle cell disease in a European comprehensive care centre.

Methods A systematic search in Medline, PubMed, Science Direct, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) database was performed to find original studies assessing barriers to ePHR adoption/use in chronic care until the end of 2018. Two researchers independently screened and extracted data. We used the PHR adoption model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology to analyze the results. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) version 2018 was used to assess the quality of evidence in the included studies. Results Sixty publications met our inclusion criteria. Issues found hindering ePHR adoption/use in chronic disease care were associated with demographic factors (e.g., patient age and gender) along with key variables related to health status, computer literacy, preferences for direct communication, and patient's strategy for coping with a chronic condition; as well as factors related to medical practice/environment (e.g., providers' lack of interest or resistance to adopting ePHRs due to workload, lack of reimbursement, and lack of user training); technological (e.g., concerns over privacy and security, interoperability with electronic health record systems, and lack of customized features for chronic conditions); and chronic disease characteristics (e.g., multiplicities of co-morbid conditions, settings, and providers involved in chronic care). Conclusions ePHRs can be meaningfully used in chronic disease care if they are implemented as a component of comprehensive care models specifically developed for this care. Our results provide insight into hurdles and barriers mitigating ePHR adoption/use in chronic disease care. A deeper understating of the interplay between these barriers will provide opportunities that can lead to an enhanced ePHR adoption/use.",Chronic diseases,Medical Informatics

Disentangling the sources of horizontal inequity in home care receipt in the Netherlands,"We study horizontal inequity in home care use in the Netherlands, where a social insurance scheme aims to allocate long-term care according to care needs. Whether the system reaches its goal depends not only on whether eligible individuals have equal access to care but also on whether entitlements for care reflect needs, irrespective of socioeconomic status and other characteristics. We assess and decompose total inequity into inequity in (i) entitlements for home care and (ii) the conversion of these entitlements into actual use. This distinction is original and important, because inequity calls for different policy responses depending on the stage at which it arises. Linking survey and administrative data on the 65 and older, we find higher income elderly to receive less home care than poorer elderly with similar needs. Although lower income elderly tend to make greater use of their entitlements, need-standardized entitlements are similar across income, education, and wealth levels. However, both use and entitlements vary by origin and place of residence. The Dutch need assessment seems effective at restricting socioeconomic inequity in home care use but may not fully prevent inequity along other dimensions. Low financial barriers and universal eligibility rules may help achieve equity in access but are not sufficient conditions.",socioeconomic inequality,Health Care Sciences & Services

A multiple case study across four countries,"BackgroundIn the regulation of healthcare, the subject of patient and family involvement figures increasingly prominently on the agenda. However, the literature on involving patients and families in regulation is still in its infancy. A systematic analysis of how patient and family involvement in regulation is accomplished across different health systems is lacking. We provide such an overview by mapping and classifying methods of patient and family involvement in regulatory practice in four countries; Norway, England, the Netherlands, and Australia. We thus provide a knowledge base that enables discussions about possible types of involvement, and advantages and difficulties of involvement encountered in practice.MethodsThe research design was a multiple case study of patient and family involvement in regulation in four countries. The authors collected 1) academic literature if available and 2) documents of regulators that describe user involvement. Based on the data collected, the authors from each country completed a pre-agreed template to describe the involvement methods. The following information was extracted and included where available: 1) Method of involvement, 2) Type of regulatory activity, 3) Purpose of involvement, 4) Who is involved and 5) Lessons learnt.ResultsOur mapping of involvement strategies showed a range of methods being used in regulation, which we classified into four categories: individual proactive, individual reactive, collective proactive, and collective reactive methods. Reported advantages included: increased quality of regulation, increased legitimacy, perceived justice for those affected, and empowerment. Difficulties were also reported concerning: how to incorporate the input of users in decisions, the fact that not all users want to be involved, time and costs required, organizational procedures standing in the way of involvement, and dealing with emotions.ConclusionsOur mapping of user involvement strategies establishes a broad variety of ways to involve patients and families. The four categories can serve as inspiration to regulators in healthcare. The paper shows that stimulating involvement in regulation is a challenging and complex task. The fact that regulators are experimenting with different methods can be viewed positively in this regard.",Australia,Health Care Sciences & Services

However, limited empirical attention has been given to the study of the consequences of later-life divorce or separation. Previous studies on gray divorce are often cross-sectional and tend to capture a mix of short- and long-term effects of divorce and possibly selection effects into divorce. Drawing on data from nine waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009/2010-2017/2018), we analyze the effect of marital break-up on the mental health of 909 adults aged 50 or over to test the crisis model and the chronic strain model of divorce. We use fixed effects linear regression models to account for time-invariant confounders and distinguish between preand post-divorce effects. Our results indicate that older adults' depressive symptoms (GHQ) increase in the years before and upon union dissolution. After separation, depressive symptoms decrease and return to approximately previous baseline levels. Our analyses on heterogeneity in the effects of gray divorce show that post-divorce adjustment is faster for childless adults than for parents. We find no evidence that adjustment after gray divorce is slower for women than for men, or for persons who already experienced a prior union dissolution than for those who separate for the first time. The results are consistent with the crisis model of divorce but in contrast with the chronic strain model of divorce.

There is a need for reliable estimates of FGM/C prevalence to inform medical and public health policy. We aimed to advance methodology for estimating the prevalence of FGM/C in diaspora by determining the prevalence of FGM/C among women giving birth in the Netherlands.MethodsTwo methods were applied to estimate the prevalence of FGM/C in women giving birth: (I) direct estimation of FGM/C was performed through a nationwide survey of all midwifery practices in the Netherlands and (II) the extrapolation model was adopted for indirect estimation of FGM/C, by applying population-based-survey data on FGM/C in country of origin to migrant women who gave birth in 2018 in the Netherlands.ResultsA nationwide survey among primary care midwifery practices that provided care for 57.5% of all deliveries in 2018 in the Netherlands, reported 523 cases of FGM/C, constituting FGM/C prevalence of 0.54%. The indirect estimation of FGM/C in an extrapolation-model resulted in an estimated prevalence of 1.55%. Possible reasons for the difference in FGM/C prevalence between direct- and indirect estimation include that the midwives were not being able to recognize, record or classify FGM/C, referral to an obstetrician before assessing FGM/C status of women and selective responding to the survey. Also, migrants might differ from people in their country of origin in terms of acculturation toward discontinuation of the practice. This may have contributed to the higher indirect-estimation of FGM/C compared to direct estimation of FGM/C.ConclusionsThe current study has provided insight into direct estimation of FGM/C through a survey of midwifery practices in the Netherlands. Evidence based on midwifery practices data can be regarded as a minimum benchmark for actual prevalence among the subpopulation of women who gave birth in a given year.",Delivery,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

This study undertook an updated survey of methodological guidance for using surrogate endpoints across international HTA agencies. We reviewed HTA and economic evaluation methods guidance from European, Australian and Canadian HTA agencies. We considered how guidelines addressed the methods for handling surrogate endpoints, including (1) level of evidence, (2) methods of validation, and (3) thresholds of acceptability. Across the 73 HTA agencies surveyed, 29 (40%) had methodological guidelines that made specific reference to consideration of surrogate outcomes. Of the 45 methods documents analysed, the majority [27 (60%)] were non-technology specific, 15 (33%) focused on pharmaceuticals and three (7%) on medical devices. The principles of the European network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA) guidelines published in 2015 on the handling of surrogate endpoints appear to have been adopted by many European HTA agencies, i.e. preference for final patient-relevant outcomes and reliance on surrogate endpoints with biological plausibility and epidemiological evidence of the association between the surrogate and final endpoint. Only a small number of HTA agencies (UK National Institute for Care and Excellence; the German Institute for Medical Documentation and Information and Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care; the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee; and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health) have developed more detailed prescriptive criteria for the acceptance of surrogate endpoints, e.g. meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials showing strong association between the treatment effect on the surrogate and final outcomes. As the decision uncertainty associated with reliance on surrogate endpoints carries a risk to patients and society, there is a need for HTA agencies to develop more detailed methodological guidance for consistent selection and evaluation of health technologies that lack definitive final patient-relevant outcome evidence at the time of the assessment.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

It is possible that only a subset of COPD patients in primary care benefit from IDM. We therefore examined which patients benefit from IDM, and whether patient characteristics predict clinical improvement over time. Method Post-hoc analyses of the RECODE trial among 1086 COPD patients. Logistic regression analyses were performed with baseline characteristics as predictors to examine determinants of improvement in QOL, defined as a minimal decline in Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) of 0.4 points after 12 and 24 months of IDM. We also performed moderation analyses to examine whether predictors of clinical improvement differed between IDM and usual care. Results Regardless of treatment type, more severe dyspnea (MRC) was the most important predictor of clinically improved QOL at 12 and 24 months, suggesting that these patients have most room for improvement. Clinical improvement with IDM was associated with female gender (12-months) and being younger (24-months), and improvement with usual care was associated with having a depression (24-months). Conclusions More severe dyspnea is a key predictor of improved QOL in COPD patients over time. More research is needed to replicate patient characteristics associated with clinical improvement with IDM, such that IDM programs can be offered to patients that benefit the most, and can potentially be adjusted to meet the needs of other patient groups as well.",Quality of life,Respiratory System

Medical researchers regularly use Delphi studies, but reports often lack detailed information on methodology and controlled feedback: in the medical literature, papers focusing on Delphi methodology issues are rare. Since the introduction of electronic surveys, details on response times remain scarce. We aim to bridge a number of gaps by providing a real world example covering methodological choices and response times in detail. Methods The objective of our e(lectronic)-Delphi study was to determine minimum standards for emergency departments (EDs) in the Netherlands. We opted for a two-part design with explicit decision rules. Part 1 focused on gathering and defining items; Part 2 addressed the main research question using an online survey tool. A two-person consensus rule was applied throughout: even after consensus on specific items was reached, panellists could reopen the discussion as long as at least two panellists argued similarly. Per round, the number of reminders sent and individual response times were noted. We also recorded the methodological considerations and evaluations made by the research team prior to as well as during the study. Results The study was performed in eight rounds and an additional confirmation round. Response rates were 100% in all rounds, resulting in 100% consensus in Part 1 and 96% consensus in Part 2. Our decision rules proved to be stable and easily applicable. Items with negative advice required more rounds before consensus was reached. Response delays were mostly due to late starts, but once panellists started, they nearly always finished the questionnaire on the same day. Reminders often yielded rapid responses. Intra-individual differences in response time were large, but quick responders remained quick. Conclusions We advise those considering Delphi study to follow the CREDES guideline, consider a two-part design, invest in personal commitment of the panellists, set clear decision rules, use a consistent lay-out and send out your reminders early. Adopting this overall approach may assist researchers in future Delphi studies and may help to improve the quality of Delphi designs in terms of improved rigor and higher response rates.",Tips and tricks,Health Care Sciences & Services

However, long-term care financing is highly fragmented in most countries and hence reducing total costs might be complicated by spillover effects: spending reductions on one type of care may be offset elsewhere in the system if consumers shop around for substitutes. These spillovers may be substantial, as we show using a reform in the budget for municipalities for the most common type of publicly financed home care in the Netherlands, domestic help. This reform generated an exogenous change in the grant for domestic help that does not depend on changes in its demand. We show that the change in budget affected consumption of this care type, but that this effect was mitigated by offsetting changes in the consumption of three other types of home care that are financed through another public scheme and are organized through regional single payers. We find that a 10 euro increase in the grant for domestic help increased use of domestic help and nursing by 0.13 and 0.03 h per capita (4.4 and 5.2% of use in 2007), whereas it decreases use of individual assistance and personal care by 0.03 and 0.05 h per capita (4.1 and 2.9% of use in 2010 and 2007, respectively). As a result, the total spending effect is closer to zero than the effect on domestic help suggests. This finding means that the fragmentation of long-term care financing limits the ability to control expenditure growth.",Social care,Geriatrics & Gerontology

Real-world evidence collected from de-identified individuals throughout the continuum of healthcare represents the most valuable source in technology evaluation. However, in the European Union, the value assessment based on real-world data has become challenging as individuals have recently been given the right to have their personal data erased in the case of consent withdrawal or when the data are regarded as being no longer necessary. This act may limit the usefulness of data in the future as it may introduce information bias. Among healthcare stakeholders, this has become an important topic of discussion because it relates to the importance of data on one side and to the need for personal data protection on the other side, especially when it comes to ""personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveals information about his or her health status"". At the forefront of these discussions are data protection issues as well as the population's trust in digital services.

This 'de-territorialisation of care' has been challenged by studies of care practices 'on the ground', showing that care is always (materially) placed. Yet, while sociological scholarship has taken the role of place seriously, there is little conceptual attention for how we may think through immateriality and the changing nature of place in health care. Based on a case study of the introduction of a sensory reality technology into a care organisation, this paper argues that we need (1) to push the definition of placed care into new (digitally produced) landscapes and (2) a new vocabulary, with which to address and conceptualise this changing nature of care places. The paper introduces the term post-place, as a first step in developing such a vocabulary. Post-place care, unlike the idea of placeless care or emplaced care, is an inclusive, open and generative concept. Its strength lies in its disruptive potential for challenging existing place-care ontologies and opening up productive space for thinking through the changing landscapes of health care.",space,Sociology

A key challenge for purchasers is to deal with the chain of multiple providers involved in caring for patients with complex needs. To date, most research has focused on differences between healthcare systems in terms of regulation, tools and the freedom that healthcare purchasers have. However, this does not explain how such different healthcare system characteristics lead to different purchasing strategies and actions. A better understanding of this link between system characteristics and purchaser behaviour would assist policymakers seeking to improve healthcare purchasing. This multiple case study conducted in England, Sweden and the Netherlands examines the link between the different healthcare systems' characteristics and the purchasers' strategies and actions when managing chronic care chains. Purchasers' strategies and actions varied in terms of the purchaser's engagement, strategic lens and influencing style. Our findings suggest that differences in purchaser competition, purchaser governance and patient choice in healthcare systems are key factors in explaining a purchaser's strategies and actions when pursuing improvements in chronic care. This study contributes to knowledge on what shapes the purchaser's role, and shows how policymakers in both insurance- and tax-based regimes can improve healthcare purchasing. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Recent research has shown, however, that even the most sophisticated risk equalization systems tend to undercompensate (overcompensate) groups of people with poor (good) self-reported health, confronting insurers with incentives for risk selection. Self-reported health measures are generally considered infeasible for use as an explicit 'risk adjuster' in risk equalization models. This study examines an alternative way to exploit this information, namely through 'constrained regression' (CR). To do so, we use administrative data (N = 17 m) and health survey information (N = 380 k) from the Netherlands. We estimate five CR models and compare these models with the actual Dutch risk equalization model of 2016 which was estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS). In the CR models, the estimated coefficients are restricted, such that the under-/overcompensation for groups based on self-reported general health is reduced by 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100%. Our results show that CR can improve outcomes for groups that are not explicitly flagged by risk adjuster variables, but worsens outcomes for groups that are explicitly flagged by risk adjuster variables. Using a new standardized metric that summarizes under-/overcompensation for both types of groups, we find that the lighter constraints can lead to better outcomes than OLS.",Survey data,Health Care Sciences & Services

From a competition policy perspective, little is known about how collaboration among healthcare providers contributes to overall patient welfare, and how a balance is achieved between scale benefits and preventing anti-competitive collusion. This paper examines the ex-post effects of a Dutch case study in which three competing hospitals have collaborated to provide high-complexity low-volume cancer surgery, an arrangement that tests the limits of permissibility under the Dutch cartel prohibition. Our preliminary empirical research demonstrated only a modest increase in price and travel time for some of the tumour surgeries. Volume analysis showed that the intended centralization of surgical procedures has not been fully realized. Our findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive self-assessment by the collaborating hospitals to ex-ante assess (potential) efficiencies and antitrust risks. Such self-assessments could benefit from research focused on which collaborations are most appropriate to achieve quality gains. For the ex-post assessment by competition authorities following the cartel prohibition, a more thorough insight into the (long-term) changes in hospital prices, profitability, and quality after collaboration is needed.",,Government & Law

Patients and Methods: PRO-CAPRI is an observational, prospective study in 10 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with mCRPC completed the EQ-5D, European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) every 3 months and European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Prostate Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-PR25) every 6 months for a maximum of 2 years. Subgroups were identified based on chemotherapy pretreatment. Outcomes were generic, cancer-specific, and prostate cancer-specific HRQoL and self-reported pain. Descriptive statistics were performed including changes over time and minimal important differences (MID) between subgroups. Results: In total, 151 included patients answered 873 questionnaires. The median follow-up from the start of the study was 19.5 months, and 84% were treated with at least 1 life-prolonging agent. Overall, patients were in good clinical condition (Eatern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1 in 78%) with normal baseline hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase. At inclusion, generic HRQoL was high with a mean EQ visual analog score of 73.2 out of 100. The lowest scores were reported on role and physical functioning (mean scores of 69 and 76 of 100, respectively), and fatigue, pain, and insomnia were the most impaired domains. These domains deteriorated in > 50% of patients. Conclusion: Although most patients were treated with new treatments during follow-up, mCRPC has a negative impact on HRQoL with deterioration in all domains over time, especially role and physical functioning. These domains need specific attention during follow-up to maintain HRQoL as long as possible by timely start of adequate supportive care management.",Registry,Urology & Nephrology

Tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHV) are foreseen to have important advantages over currently used bioprosthetic heart valve substitutes, most importantly reducing valve degeneration with subsequent reduction of re-intervention. We performed early Health Technology Assessment of hypothetical TEHV in elderly patients (>= 70 years) requiring surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to assess the potential of TEHV and to inform future development decisions. Methods Using a patient-level simulation model, the potential cost-effectiveness of TEHV compared with bioprostheses was predicted from a societal perspective. Anticipated, but currently hypothetical improvements in performance of TEHV, divided in durability, thrombogenicity, and infection resistance, were explored in scenario analyses to estimate quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain, cost reduction, headroom, and budget impact. Results Durability of TEHV had the highest impact on QALY gain and costs, followed by infection resistance. Improved TEHV performance (- 50% prosthetic valve-related events) resulted in lifetime QALY gains of 0.131 and 0.043, lifetime cost reductions of euro639 and euro368, translating to headrooms of euro3255 and euro2498 per hypothetical TEHV compared to SAVR and TAVI, respectively. National savings in the first decade after implementation varied between euro2.8 and euro11.2 million (SAVR) and euro3.2-euro12.8 million (TAVI) for TEHV substitution rates of 25-100%. Conclusions Despite the relatively short life expectancy of elderly patients undergoing SAVR/TAVI, hypothetical TEHV are predicted to be cost-effective compared to bioprostheses, commercially viable and result in national cost savings when biomedical engineers succeed in realising improved durability and/or infection resistance of TEHV.",Tissue-engineered heart valves,Health Care Sciences & Services

The Causal Effect of High Fertility on Later-Life Loneliness in Eastern Europe,"Levels of later-life loneliness are high in Eastern Europe. We assess whether having more children is protective against later-life loneliness for Eastern-European mothers and fathers. Drawing on Generations and Gender Surveys data of 25,479 parents aged 50-80 from eight Eastern-European countries, we adopt an instrumental approach exploiting parents' preference for mixed-sex offspring to estimate the causal effect of having additional children on feelings of loneliness. We find that having an additional child has a causal protective effect against loneliness for mothers. Ordinary least squares regression models also show a weak but statistically significant negative association between number of children and later-life loneliness among fathers. However, results of the instrumental variable analyses are inconclusive for this group. We thus do not find statistically significant causal evidence that having an additional child is protective against loneliness for fathers. Our results underline the importance of addressing reverse causality and selection bias when investigating the links between number of children and later-life loneliness, particularly among women. The causal evidence presented here suggests that the trend towards families with fewer children noted in several Eastern-European countries may place new cohorts of older Eastern-Europeans, and in particular Eastern-European women, at risk of stronger feelings of loneliness.",Instrumental variable,Sociology

Valuing ICECAP-O and ICECAP-A States Based on Experienced Utility Using Subjective Well-Being Data,"Background. The ICECAP-O and the ICECAP-A are validated capability well-being instruments. To be used in economic evaluations, multidimensional instruments require weighting of the distinguished well-being states. These weights are usually obtained through ex ante preference elicitation (i.e., decision utility) but could also be based on experienced utility. Objective. This article describes the development of value sets for ICECAP-O and ICECAP-A based on experienced utility and compares them with current decision utility weights. Methods. Data from 2 cross-sectional samples corresponding to the target groups of ICECAP-O and ICECAP-A were used in 2 separate analyses. The utility impacts of ICECAP-O and ICECAP-A levels were assessed through regression models using a composite measure of subjective well-being as a proxy for experienced utility. The observed utility impacts were rescaled to match the 0 to 1 range of the existing value set. Results. The calculated experienced utility values were similar to the decision utility weights for some of the ICECAP dimensions but deviated for others. The largest differences were found for weights of the ICECAP-O dimension enjoyment and the ICECAP-A dimensions attachment and autonomy. Conclusions. The results suggest a different weighting of ICECAP-O and ICECAP-A levels if experienced utility is used instead of decision utility.",decision utility,Medical Informatics

Administrative staff, managers and sometimes a few professionals, representing only one or two disciplines, decide what to change and how. Consequently, PSPs are not fully adapted to the professionals' needs or to the local context and as a result, adoption is low. To support adoption, two theoretical concepts, Participatory Design and Experiential Learning were combined in a new model: Adaptive Design. The aim was to explore whether Adaptive Design supports adaptation and adoption of PSPs by engaging all professionals and creating time to (re) design, reflect and learn as a team. The Time Out Procedure (TOP) and Debriefing (plus) for improving patient safety in the operating theatre (OT) was used as PSP.MethodsQualitative exploratory multi-site study using participatory action research as a research design. The implementation process consisted of four phases: 1) start-up: providing information by presentations and team meetings, 2) pilot: testing the prototype with 100 surgical procedures, 3) small scale implementation: with one or two surgical disciplines, 4) implementation hospital-wide: including all surgical disciplines. In iterations, teams (re) designed, tested, evaluated, and if necessary adapted TOPplus. Gradually all professionals were included. Adaptations in content, process and layout of TOPplus were measured following each iteration. Adoption was monitored until final implementation in every hospital's OT.Results10 Dutch hospitals participated. Adaptations varied per hospital, but all hospitals adapted both procedures. Adaptations concerned the content, process and layout of TOPplus. Both procedures were adopted in all OTs, but user participation and time to include all users varied between hospitals. Ultimately all users were actively involved and TOPplus was implemented in all OTs.ConclusionsEngaging all professionals in a structured bottom-up implementation approach with a focus on learning, improves adaptation and adoption of a PSP. As a result, all 10 participating hospitals implemented TOPplus with all surgical disciplines in all OTs. Adaptive Design gives professionals the opportunity to adapt the PSP to their own needs and their specific local context. All hospitals adapted TOPplus, but without compromising the essential features for its effectiveness.",Learn,Health Care Sciences & Services

This poses a risk for impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We assessed HRQOL in a cohort of young adults with T1DM in the Netherlands, and compared outcomes with those of Dutch norm groups of healthy young adults and young adults with a chronic disease.MethodsWe analyzed data collected in a larger evaluation study on transitional care for young adults with T1DM in a nationwide sample in the Netherlands, including twelve participating hospitals. These data had been obtained from online questionnaires completed by young adults with T1DM after they had transferred to adult care. HRQOL was self-reported with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory for young adults (PedsQL-YA).ResultsOne hundred and sixty-five young adults with T1DM participated (44.2% response); and they scored significantly worse than did healthy peers on all domains of HRQOL, except social functioning. Particularly, functioning at school or work was worse than that of the norm group. The study group's HRQOL-scores were comparable to norm scores of young adults with chronic diseases, although the physical and social functioning of young people with T1DM was better. One quarter (26.1%) of all young adults with T1DM reported fatigue.ConclusionsDuring transition to adulthood, young adults with T1DM struggle to maintain a balance between the demands of managing a disease and their life. Many of them encounter problems at work or school, and suffer from fatigue. These findings underscore the need to regularly assess HRQOL, and to discuss work- and education-related issues in clinical practice.",Young adults,Health Care Sciences & Services

On the regulation of hospital mergers from a quality of care perspective,"Purpose Despite the continuation of hospital mergers in many western countries, it is uncertain if and how hospital mergers impact the quality of care. This poses challenges for the regulation of mergers. The purpose of this paper is to understand: how regulators and hospitals frame the impact of merging on the quality and safety of care and how hospital mergers might be regulated, given their uncertain impact on quality and safety of care. Design/methodology/approach This paper studies the regulation of hospital mergers in The Netherlands. In a qualitative study design, it draws on 30 semi-structured interviews with inspectors from the Dutch Health and Youth Care Inspectorate (Inspectorate) and respondents from three hospitals that merged between 2013 and 2015. This paper draws from literature on process-based regulation to understand how regulators can monitor hospital mergers. Findings This paper finds that inspectors and hospital respondents frame the process of merging as potentially disruptive to daily care practices. While inspectors emphasise the dangers of merging, hospital respondents report how merging stimulated them to reflect on their care practices and how it afforded learning between hospitals. Although the Inspectorate considers mergers a risk to quality of care, their regulatory practices are hesitant. Originality/value This qualitative study sheds light on how merging might affect key hospital processes and daily care practices. It offers opportunities for the regulation of hospital mergers that acknowledges rather than aims to dispel the uncertain and potentially ambiguous impact of mergers on quality and safety of care.",Mergers,Health Care Sciences & Services

Empirical evidence from a nationwide survey study,"Background Consumer mobility is an important aspect of a health insurance system based on managed competition. Both the general population and insured with a chronic illness should enjoy an equal opportunity to switch their insurer every year. We studied possible differences in the rates of switching between these two groups in the Netherlands. Methods A structured questionnaire was sent to 1500 members of Nivel's Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel (response rate: 47%) and to 1911 chronically ill members of the National Panel of the Chronically ill and Disabled (response rate: 84%) in February 2016. Associations between switching and background characteristics were estimated using logistic regression analyses with interaction effects. Results In general, we did not find significant differences in switching rates between the general population and chronically ill population. However, a combination of the population and background characteristics demonstrated that young insured with a chronic illness switched significantly less often than young insured from the general population (1% versus 17%). Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the group of young people with a chronic illness is less inclined to switch insurer. This observation suggests that this group might either face difficulties or barriers which prevents them from switching, or that they experience a high level of satisfaction with their current insurer. Further research should therefore focus on unravelling the mechanisms which explain the differences in switching rates.",Health system reform,Health Care Sciences & Services

We report the first experimental test of reference-dependence with respect to SLE for TTO and extend this approach to standard gamble (SG). In two experiments, subjects' SLEs were used to construct different versions of 10-year TTO and SG tasks, with the gauge duration either described as occurring above or below life expectation. Our analyses suggest that both TTO and SG weights were affected by SLE as predicted by prospect theory with SLE as reference point. Subjects gave up fewer years in TTO and were less risk-tolerant in SG below SLE, implying that weights derived from these health state valuation methods for durations below SLE will be biased upwards.

With SBR the government can reclaim its influence on the meta level while maintaining the level of freedom of management at the organizational level. Instead of aiming for more or stricter regulation, the government could shift its role to meta-regulation, meaning that the public regulator redefines its role as an assessor and stimulator of the quality of governance in terms of self-regulation.

Co-creation of care, based on the quality of communication and relationships between healthcare professionals and patients, may therefore be valuable. This longitudinal study investigates the relationships of co-creation of care to physical and social well-being and satisfaction with care among multimorbid patients in primary care. Methods: In 2017 and 2018, longitudinal surveys were conducted among multimorbid patients from seven primary care practices in Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands (n = 138, age = 73.50 +/- 9.99). Paired sample t-tests and multivariate regression analyses were performed. (3) Results: Co-creation of care improved significantly over time (t = 2.25, p = 0.026), as did social well-being (t = 2.31, p = 0.022) and physical well-being (t = 2.72, p = 0.007) but not satisfaction with care (t = 0.18, p = 0.858). Improvements in co-creation of care from T0 to T1 were associated with social well-being (B = 0.157, p = 0.002), physical well-being (B = 0.216, p = 0.000) and satisfaction with care (B = 0.240, p = 0.000). (4) Conclusions: Thus, investment in co-creation of care by primary care practices may lead to better outcomes for multimorbid patients.",satisfaction with care,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

However, it is not clear what PCC exactly looks like in practice for patients with multi-morbidity. A better understanding of multi-morbid patients' views on what PCC should look like and which elements are most important may help to improve care delivery for this vulnerable population. The present study thus aimed to identify views of patients with multi-morbidity on the relative importance of PCC aspects in a Dutch primary care setting. Methods Interviews were conducted with 16 patients with multi-morbidity using Q-methodology, which combines quantitative and qualitative analyses. The participants ranked 28 statements about the eight dimensions of PCC (patients' preferences, information and education, access to care, emotional support, family and friends, continuity and transition, physical comfort, and coordination of care) by relative importance. By-person factor analysis using centroid factor extraction and varimax rotation were used to reveal factors that represent viewpoints. Qualitative interview data were used to interpret the viewpoints. Results The analyses revealed three factors representing three distinct viewpoints of patients with multi-morbidity on what is important for patient-centered care in the primary care setting. Patients with viewpoint 1 are prepared proactive patients who seem to be well-off and want to be in charge of their own care. To do so, they seek medical information and prefer to be supported by a strongly coordinated multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals. Patients with viewpoint 2 are everyday patients who visit GPs and require well-coordinated, respectful, and supportive care. Patients with viewpoint 3 are vulnerable patients who are less resourceful in terms of communication skills and finances, and thus require accessible care and professionals taking the lead while treating them with dignity and respect. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that not all patients with multi-morbidity require the same type of care delivery, and that not all aspects of PCC delivery are equally important to all patients.",Q-methodology,General & Internal Medicine

However, substitution to home care or informal care might be harder to achieve for some conditions than for others. Therefore, insight is needed in differences in LTC use, and the role of potential informal care givers, across specific conditions. We analyze differences in LTC use of previously independent older patients after a fracture of femur and stroke, and in particular examine to what extent having a partner and children affects LTC use for these conditions. Methods Using administrative data on Dutch previously independent older people (55+) with a fracture of femur or stroke in 2013, we investigate their LTC use in the year after the condition takes place. We use administrative treatment data to select individuals who were treated by a medical specialist for a stroke or femoral fracture in 2013. Subsequent LTC use is measured as using no formal care, home care, institutional care or being deceased at 13 consecutive four-weekly periods after initial treatment. We relate long-term care use to having a partner, having children, other personal characteristics and the living environment. Results The probability to use no formal care 1 year after the initial treatment is equally high for both conditions, but patients with a fracture are more likely to use home care, while patients with a stroke are more likely to use institutional care or have died. Having a spouse has a negative effect on home care and institutional care use, but the timing of the effect, especially for institutional care, differs strongly between the two conditions. Having children also has a negative effect on formal care use, and this effect is consistently larger for patients with a fracture than patients with a stroke. Conclusion As the condition and the effect of potential informal care givers matter for subsequent long-term care use, policy makers should take the expected prevalence of specific conditions within the older people population into account when designing long-term care policies.",Stroke,Geriatrics & Gerontology

To prevent caregiver burden and to enhance the capacity to provide care it is important to have insight in their support needs. The purpose of this study was to identify profiles of family caregivers who provide care to patients at the end of life at home. Methods A Q-methodological study was conducted in which family caregivers ranked 40 statements on support needs and experiences with caregiving. Thereafter they explained their ranking in an interview. By-person factor analysis was used to analyse the rankings and qualitative data was used to support the choice of profiles. A set of 41 family caregivers with a variety on background characteristics who currently or recently provided care for someone at the end of life at home were included. Results Four distinct profiles were identified; profile (1) those who want appreciation and an assigned contact person; profile (2) was bipolar. The positive pole (2+) comprised those who have supportive relationships and the negative pole (2-) those who wish for supportive relationships; profile (3) those who want information and practical support, and profile (4) those who need time off. The profiles reflect different support needs and experiences with caregiving. Conclusions Family caregivers of patients at the end of life have varying support needs and one size does not fit all. The profiles are relevant for healthcare professionals and volunteers in palliative care as they provide an overview of the main support needs among family caregivers of patients near the end of life.

Nursing homes and home care, however have received much less attention. An increasing number of people need health services in nursing homes and at home, and the services are struggling with fragmentation of care, discontinuity and restricted resource availability. The aim of the study was to explore the current challenges in quality and safety work as perceived by managers and employees in nursing homes and home care services. Method The study is a multiple explorative case study of two nursing homes and two home care services in Norway. Managers and employees participated in focus groups and individual interviews. The data material was analyzed using directed content analysis guided by the theoretical framework 'Organizing for Quality', focusing on the work needed to meet quality and safety challenges. Results Challenges in quality and safety work were interrelated and depended on many factors. In addition, they often implied trade-offs for both managers and employees. Managers struggled to maintain continuity of care due to sick leave and continuous external-facilitated change processes. Employees struggled with heavier workloads and fewer resources, resulting in less time with patients and poorer quality of patient care. The increased external pressure affected the possibility to work towards engagement and culture for improvement, and to maintain quality and safety as a collective effort at managerial and employee levels. Conclusion Despite contextual differences due to the structure, size, nature and location of the nursing homes and home care services, the challenges were similar across settings. Our study indicates a dualistic contextual dimension. Understanding contextual factors is central for targeting improvement interventions to specific settings. Context is, however, not independent from the work that managers do; it can be and is acted upon in negotiations and interactions to better support managers' and employees' work on quality and safety in nursing homes and home care.",Theory development,Health Care Sciences & Services

The aim of our study was to provide insight into real-world healthcare costs of patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Data were obtained from the Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry for patients who were registered between July 2012 and December 2018. Mean total/monthly costs per patient were reported for all patients, patients who did not receive systemic therapy, and patients who received systemic therapy. Furthermore, mean episode/monthly costs per line of therapy and drug were reported for patients who received systemic therapy. Mean total/monthly costs were Euro 89,240/Euro 6809: Euro 7988/Euro 2483 for patients who did not receive systemic therapy (n = 784) and Euro 105,078/Euro 7652 for patients who received systemic therapy (n = 4022).

To guide patient flow to primary care, the Chinese government has rolled out a sequence of health care reforms which improve the affordability, the infrastructure and workforce of the primary care system. However, these measures have not yielded the desired effect on the utilization of primary care, which is lowest in urban areas. It is unclear how the factors identified to influence facility choice in urban China are actually impacting choice behaviour. We conducted a discrete choice experiment to elicit the quantitative impact of facility attributes when choosing a health care facility for first visit and analysed how the stated choice varies with these attributes. We found that the respondents placed different weights on the identified attributes, depending on whether they perceived their condition to be minor or severe. For conditions perceived as minor, the respondents valued visit time, equipment and medical skill most. For conditions perceived as severe, they placed most importance on equipment, travel time and facility size. We found that for conditions perceived as minor, only 14% preferred visiting a facility over opting out, a percentage which would more than double to 37% if community health centres were maximally improved. For conditions perceived as severe, improvements in community health centres may almost double first visits to primary care, mostly from patients who would otherwise choose higher-level facilities. Our findings suggest that for both severity conditions, improvements to medical equipment and medical skill at community health centres in urban China can effectively direct patient flow to primary care and promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the urban health system.",decision-making,Health Care Sciences & Services

Methods: We linked population-wide mortality, hospitalization and municipality registries to identify influenza-related deaths and hospitalizations, and used health interview surveys to identify medication use and outpatient visits during 1996-2008. We applied a regression discontinuity design to estimate the intention-to-treat effect of the personal invitation for a free influenza vaccination sent to every Dutch inhabitant at age 65 years on each of the outcomes, separately in influenza-epidemic and non-epidemic months. Results: Invitation receipt for free influenza vaccination at age 65 led to a 9.8 percentage points [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.5 to16.1; P<0.01] rise in influenza vaccination. During influenza-epidemic months, it was associated with 1.5 fewer influenza/pneumonia deaths per 100 000 individuals (95% CI = -3.1 to -0.0; P = 0.05), a 15 percentage point lower probability to use prescribed medicines (95% CI = -28 to -3; P = 0.02) and 0.13 fewer General Practitioner (GP) visits per month (95% CI = -0.28 to 0.02; P = 0.09), while the association with hospitalizations due to influenza/pneumonia was small and imprecisely estimated (seven more hospitalizations per 100 000 individuals, 95% CI = -20 to 33; P = 0.63).

The PCCS team provides palliative care for mainly cancer patients and their family members and manages the patient pathway after being discharged from the hospital. The service started in 2014 with 300-400 patient visits per year. The aim of this study is to give a comprehensive overview of the PCCS programme guided by a conceptual framework designed by SELFIE (""Sustainable intEgrated chronic care modeLs for multi-morbidity: delivery, FInancing, and performancE""), a Horizon2020 funded EU project and to identify the facilitators and barriers to its wider implementation. Methods PCCS has been selected by the SELFIE consortium for in-depth evaluation as one of the Hungarian integrated care models for persons with multi-morbidity. The qualitative analysis of the PCCS programme was based on available documents of the care provider and interviews with different stakeholders related to the programme. Results The integrated, multidisciplinary and patient-centred approach was well-received among the patients, family members and clinical departments, as verified by the increasing number of requests for consultations. As a result of the patient pathway management across providers (e.g. from inpatient care to homecare) a higher level of coordination could be achieved in the continuity of care for seriously-ill patients. The regulatory framework has only partially been established, policies to integrate care across organizations and sectors and adequate financial mechanism to support the enhancement and sustainability of the PCCS are still missing. Conclusions The service integration of palliative care could be implemented successfully in an academic hospital in Hungary. However, the continuation and enhancement of the programme will require further evidence on the performance of the integrated model of palliative care and a more systematic approach particularly regarding the evaluation, financing and implementation process.",Qualitative study,Health Care Sciences & Services

Tariff sets are available for Australia, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA. Objective Our objective was to develop tariff sets for the CarerQol instrument for Hungary, Poland and Slovenia and to compare these with the existing value sets. Methods Discrete-choice experiments were carried out in Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. Data were collected through an online survey between November 2018 and January 2019, using representative samples of 1000 respondents per country. Tariffs were calculated from coefficient estimates from panel mixed multinomial logit models with random parameters. Results All seven CarerQol domains contributed significantly to the utility associated with different caregiving situations. Attributes valued highest were 'physical health' (tariffs for no problems were 15.6-21.8), 'mental health' (18.1-18.9) and 'fulfilment' (16.3-22.9). Value sets were comparable across the countries, although in Poland 'a lot of fulfilment' was valued higher (22.9) than in Hungary (16.3) and Slovenia (17.1). Compared with existing value sets, in the three Central European countries, 'fulfilment' was more important, whereas 'financial problems' were less important. Conclusion For the first time in the Central and Eastern European region, country-specific tariffs are now available for the Hungarian, Polish and Slovenian versions of the CarerQol instrument. This facilitates inclusion of the impact of informal care in economic evaluations.

We shed light on the implications of the 2017 ACC/AHA for population subgroups and high-risk individuals who were eligible for non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Methods Data was obtained from the Iran national STEPS 2016 study. Participants included 27,738 adults aged >= 25 years as a representative sample of Iranians. Regression models of survey design were used to examine the determinants of prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension. Results The prevalence of hypertension based on JNC8 was 29.9% (95% CI: 29.2-30.6), which soared to 53.7% (52.9-54.4) based on the 2017 ACC/AHA. The percentage of awareness, treatment, and control were 59.2% (58.0-60.3), 80.2% (78.9-81.4), and 39.1% (37.4-40.7) based on JNC8, which dropped to 37.1% (36.2-38.0), 71.3% (69.9-72.7), and 19.6% (18.3-21.0), respectively, by applying the 2017 ACC/AHA. Based on the new guideline, adults aged 25-34 years had the largest increase in prevalence (from 7.3 to 30.7%). They also had the lowest awareness and treatment rate, contrary to the highest control rate (36.5%) between age groups. Compared with JNC8, based on the 2017 ACC/AHA, 24, 15, 17, and 11% more individuals with dyslipidaemia, high triglycerides, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease events, respectively, fell into the hypertensive category. Yet, based on the 2017 ACC/AHA, 68.2% of individuals falling into the hypertensive category were eligible for receiving pharmacologic therapy (versus 95.7% in JNC8). LDL cholesterol< 130 mg/dL, sufficient physical activity (Metabolic Equivalents >= 600/week), and Body Mass Index were found to change blood pressure by - 3.56(- 4.38, - 2.74), - 2.04(- 2.58, - 1.50), and 0.48(0.42, 0.53) mmHg, respectively. Conclusions Switching from JNC8 to 2017 ACC/AHA sharply increased the prevalence and drastically decreased the awareness, treatment, and control in Iran. Based on the 2017 ACC/AHA, more young adults and those with chronic comorbidities fell into the hypertensive category; these individuals might benefit from earlier interventions such as lifestyle modifications. The low control rate among individuals receiving treatment warrants a critical review of hypertension services.",Iran,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

This study aims to estimate the costs and health effects of earlier interventions in Sierra Leone. Methods A deterministic and a stochastic compartment model describing the EVD outbreak was estimated using a variety of data sources. Costs and Disability-Adjusted Life Years were used to estimate and compare scenarios of earlier interventions. Results Four weeks earlier interventions would have averted 10,257 (IQR 4353-18,813) cases and 8835 (IQR 3766-16,316) deaths. This implies 456 (IQR 194-841) thousand DALYs and 203 (IQR 87-374) million $US saved. The greatest losses occurred outside the healthcare sector. Conclusions Earlier response in an Ebola outbreak saves lives and costs.

As a first step to determine whether investing in such a system offers value for money, this study used contingent valuation to estimate people's willingness to pay for such an early warning system in six European countries. The contingent valuation experiment was conducted through online questionnaires administered in February to March 2018 to cross-sectional, representative samples in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and The Netherlands, yielding a total sample size of 3140. Mean willingness to pay for an early warning system was euro21.80 (median euro10.00) per household per month. Pooled regression results indicate that willingness to pay increased with household income and risk aversion, while they decreased with age. Overall, our results indicate that approximately 80-90% of people would be willing to pay for an increase in health safety in the form of an early warning system for infectious diseases and food-borne outbreaks.

Forty-six indicators are used to prioritize supervision of psychiatric hospitals. The objective of this study is to define a smaller set of weighted indicators which reflects a consensus among inspectors about which aspects are most important for risk assessment. Methods The set of 46 indicators, complemented with missing information, was reduced to six indicators by means of interviews, group discussions and ranking among the inspectors. These indicators were used as attributes in a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to define their weights. Results Twenty-six inspectors defined the top four indicators suitable for the risk assessment of psychiatric hospitals. These are: the policy on prevention of compulsory treatment; the policy on dysfunctional professionals; the quality of internal research after a serious incident; and the implementation of multidisciplinary guidelines on suicidal behaviour. These indicators share the same importance with regard to risk assessment. The screening of somatic symptoms and the policy on integrated care are important indicators too, but less relevant. Conclusion Through a DCE, we reduced the amount of information for risk assessment of psychiatric hospitals to six weighted indicators.

The prevailing empirical finding, however, is decreasing impatience (DI), meaning that levels of impatience decrease over time. Theoretically, such changes in impatience are crucial to understand behavior and self-control problems. Very few methods exist to measure DI without being restricted to or confounded by certain assumptions about the discounting function or utility curve. One such measure is the recently introduced DI-index, which has been applied to both monetary and health outcomes. The DI-index quantifies the deviation from constant impatience and is flexible enough to capture both increasing and decreasing impatience. In this study, we apply the DI-index to measure impatience for health outcomes in a reference-dependent framework. That is, we measure impatience for both health gains and health losses compared to a reference-point, in individual and societal settings, using a within-subjects design (n = 98). We allowed for both positive and negative discounting, since negative discounting has been observed for losses (i.e. preferring to incur losses earlier rather than later) in earlier work. To capture changes in time inconsistency when subjects show negative discounting (i.e. patience), we modify the DI-index to a decreasing (im)patience (DIP)-index, which can be applied without loss of generality. As in earlier work, we observe large heterogeneity in time consistency; i.e., a mix of decreasing, increasing and constant (im)patience. Across all DIP-indices elicited, increasing impatience was the modal preference for those satisfying impatience, and decreasing patience for those satisfying patience. No systematic differences were observed between health gains and losses or between societal and individual outcomes. This suggests that for health outcomes both patient and impatient individuals assign more importance to time differences delayed further in the future.",,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Given the prominent role of informal caregivers in care delivery processes to persons with intellectual disabilities (PWID), they are expected to benefit from person-centered care (PCC) and co-creation of care as well. This study aims to identify the relationship between PCC, co-creation of care and outcomes among informal caregivers of PWID. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2015 among informal caregivers of PWID (45.8% parents, 44.1% siblings, 10.1% other family member). All PWID were living in residential homes of a long-term care organization in the Eastern part of the Netherlands. For every PWID, the most important informal caregiver was invited to participate. Nine hundred and forty-one invitations were sent out and 289 of them responded (31% response rate). Mean age of informal caregivers was 61.80 (SD 11.21; range 23-90) years old. About half of the respondents (55%) were female and 23% were single. Most of the respondents (83%) were providing informal care for more than 10 years and 29% provided informal care for 8 hours per week or more. Correlation analyses indicated that PCC and co-creation of care were positively related to informal caregivers' satisfaction with care and their own well-being. Regression analyses showed that PCC is associated with satisfaction with care (beta = 0.60, p < 0.001) and well-being (beta = 0.22, p < 0.01) while controlling for background characteristics. Relational co-creation was also positively associated with satisfaction with care (beta = 0.15, p < 0.01) and well-being (beta = 0.20, p < 0.01). This study provided the first empirical evidence that PCC and co-creation of care matter for satisfaction with care and the well-being of informal caregivers of PWID.",well-being,Rehabilitation

At first sight the solution seems simple: discard rules and give caregivers more resources to provide personalized care. Based on qualitative research in four elderly care organizations in the Netherlands, this paper shows that regulatory pressure is a persistent problem that cannot be solved on an individual level, as it results from a disconnect between the work of different actors in the healthcare system. Drawing on concepts from Organization Studies, the paper shows that the work of caregivers, healthcare managers and external actors is often decoupled. Caregivers experience regulatory pressure when the origin and function of rules are unclear. The studied care organizations are experimenting with rules, reconsidering and creating functional rules. They do so by stimulating reflection among actors in the healthcare system, thereby recoupling their work. The findings suggest that recoupling can be achieved by creating comfort zones, focusing on stimulating debate between stakeholders on the functionality and origin of rules and aligning ideas about good quality care, the role different actors can play and the rules that are needed to accommodate this.

This study investigates how the three social needs as proposed by Social Production Function theory-the needs for affection, behavioral confirmation, and status-relate to psychological strengths (self-evaluation, hope, and self-regulatory ability), loneliness, and subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive and negative affect). Moreover, possible mechanisms are explored. Using the first release sample of the LifeLines study (N = 13,301) and four other samples (N = 1094, N = 456, N = 415, and N = 142), we found that the three social needs yielded a robust factor structure, and related differentially to gender and education. Their associations with all three psychological strengths were substantial. Affection need fulfilment related most strongly to both emotional and social loneliness, but the expected stronger association of behavioral confirmation with social loneliness was not found. As expected, affection related most strongly to life satisfaction and least strongly to positive affect, whereas status related most strongly to positive affect and least strongly to life satisfaction. Of all social needs, behavioral confirmation had comparatively the strongest negative association with negative affect. With regard to mechanisms, affection was found to have a partial indirect effect on life satisfaction via self-evaluation, hope, and self-regulatory ability, while status had a modest indirect effect via self-regulatory ability on positive affect. It is concluded that different need fulfillments make unique contributions to different types of well-functioning, implying that a mix of social need satisfiers (i.e. different kinds of social relationships and other social provisions) are needed for individuals to function well. This knowledge may support interventions and policy directed at both individual and societal well-being.",Psychological strengths,Social Sciences - Other Topics

It combines a networked governance perspective with responsive regulation theory to show the mechanisms that have added to significant changes in medical cost management in the Netherlands. In a five-year period, hospital practices transitioned from cosmetic compliance with performance regulation and strategic upcoding to institutionalized compliance more in line with regulatory goals. The article demonstrates how policy changes transformed incentive structures, introduced new forms of accountability, and added actors to the network with technocratic disciplining tasks. The networked character of performance regulation offered opportunities for a responsive, non-coercive regulatory strategy that engaged various actors in a regulatory conversation about strategic coding. Responsive regulation can reduce strategic responses to performance regulation and manage the gap between administrative and clinical logics. The case study contributes to our understanding of the effectiveness of responsive, non-punitive regulation in networked settings.",,Public Administration

Did this come to pass, and what role, if any, did government transfers play in the evolution of these inequalities? Motivated by these questions, this paper seeks to (i) study the evolution of IRHI during the crisis, and (ii) decompose these evolutions to examine the separate roles of government versus market transfers. Using panel data for 7 EU countries from 2004 to 2013, we find no evidence that IRHI persistently rose after 2008, even in countries most affected by the crisis. Our decomposition reveals that, while the health of the poorest did indeed worsen during the crisis, IRHI were prevented from increasing by the relative stickiness of old age pension benefits compared to the market incomes of younger groups. Austerity measures weakened the IRHI reducing effect of government transfers. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",Economic crisis,Health Care Sciences & Services

Quantitatively summarize patient preferences for European licensed relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) disease-modifying treatment (DMT) options. Methods. To identify and summarize the most important RRMS DMT characteristics, a literature review, exploratory physician interviews, patient focus groups, and confirmatory physician interviews were conducted in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was developed and executed to measure patient preferences for the most important DMT characteristics. The resulting DCE data (n=799 and n=363 respondents in the United Kingdom and Germany, respectively) were analyzed using Bayesian mixed logit models. The estimated individual-level patient preferences were subsequently summarized using 3 additional analyses: the quality of the choice data was assessed using individual-level R-2 estimates, individual-level preferences for the available DMTs were aggregated into DMT-specific preference shares, and a principal component analysis was performed to explain the patients' choice process. Results. DMT usage differed between RRMS patients in Germany and the United Kingdom but aggregate patient preferences were similar. Across countries, 42% of all patients preferred oral medications, 38% infusions, 16% injections, and 4% no DMT. The most often preferred DMT was natalizumab (26%) and oral DMT cladribine tablets (22%). The least often preferred were mitoxantrone and the beta-interferon injections (1%-3%). Patient preferences were strongly correlated with patients' MS disease duration and DMT experience, and differences in patient preferences could be summarized using 8 principle components that together explain 99% of the variation in patients' DMT preferences. Conclusion. This study summarizes patient preferences for the included DMTs, facilitates shared decision making along the dimensions that are relevant to RRMS patients, and introduces methods in the medical DCE literature that are ideally suited to summarize the impact of DMT introductions in preexisting treatment landscapes.",patient preferences,Medical Informatics

Their role could be influenced by their social context but more specifically by subjective norms (i.e. patients' view of the role that significant others expect them to play in the decision-making process) and perceived social support. We explore how social context (i.e. subjective norms and social support) relates to how the patient perceives their role in the decision-making process. Also, we explore the level of alignment on subjective norms between patients and their informal caregivers and nurses.MethodsMixed-method study among older patients, informal caregivers and nurses. For the quantitative questionnaire, a home care organisation randomly selected patients. The patients were asked to identify their informal caregiver and the home care organisation was asked to identify the nurse who was most involved in their care. In total 133 patients, 64 informal caregivers and 72 nurses were questioned. Participants for the qualitative interviews were selected using convenience sampling, resulting in the inclusion of ten patients, five informal caregivers and six nurses. Subjective norms were based on a previous study. Social support was measured with the 'social support for health scale' of the Health Literacy Questionnaire. The Control Preference Scale was used as outcome variable. The interviews focused on subjective norms, social support and how the patient perceived their role. Quantitative analysis included the calculation of subjective norm difference scores between respondent groups, one-way analysis of variance and multinomial logistic regression analysis. Directed content analysis was applied to the interviews using Atlas TI.ResultsLower difference scores were found for patient-informal caregiver dyads (mean=0.95), implying more alignment than in patient-nurse dyads (mean=2.12). Patients perceiving themselves to have a shared or passive role tend to believe that they are expected to leave decision-making to the health care provider. Higher social support scores related more to a shared role. Alignment relates to: familiarity with the patient's preferences, overprotectiveness or valuing the care provider's opinion and the severity of the patient's medical history.ConclusionPatients and informal caregivers align on whether the patient should make decisions. The more patients believe that they are expected to leave decision-making to the health care provider, the more they perceive themselves as having a passive role. The more patients who feel they have support, the more they perceive themselves as having a shared role. Patients and caregivers could be facilitated to make role expectations explicit.

Based on an ethnographic study, the results illustrate how physicians initially construct conflicting leadership narratives - heroic (pioneer), clinical (patient's guardian) and collaborative (linking pin) leader - in reaction to changing organisational and clinical demands. Each narrative contains a particular relational-agentic view of physicians regarding the contexts of hospitals: respectively as individually shapeable; disconnected or collectively adjustable. Interactions between teachers, participants, group discussions and in-hospital experiences led to the gradual deconstruction of the heroic -and clinical leader narrative. Collaborative leadership emerged as the desirable new professional identity. We contribute to the professional identity literature by illustrating how physicians make a gradual transition from viewing organisational and institutional contexts as pre-given to contexting, that is, continuously adjusting the context with others. When engaged in contexting, physicians increasingly consider managers and directors as necessary partners and colleague-physicians who do not wish to change as the new 'anti-identity'.",physicians,Sociology

Our aim was to examine whether and how panel participation influenced participants' views on this topic. Participants (n =24) deliberated on eight reimbursement cases in September and October, 2017. Using Q methodology, we identified three distinct viewpoints before (T-0) and after (T-1) panel participation. At T-0, viewpoint 1 emphasised that access to healthcare is a right and that prioritisation should be based solely on patients' needs. Viewpoint 2 acknowledged scarcity of resources and emphasised the importance of treatment-related health gains. Viewpoint 3 focused on helping those in need, favouring younger patients, patients with a family, and treating diseases that heavily burden the families of patients. At T-1, viewpoint 1 had become less opposed to prioritisation and more considerate of costs. Viewpoint 2 supported out-of-pocket payments more strongly. A new viewpoint 3 emerged that emphasised the importance of cost-effectiveness and that prioritisation should consider patient characteristics, such as their age. Participants' views partly remained stable, specifically regarding equal access and prioritisation based on need and health gains. Notable changes concerned increased support for prioritisation, consideration of costs, and cost-effectiveness. Further research into the effects of deliberative methods is required to better understand how they may contribute to the legitimacy of and public support for allocation decisions in healthcare.

Methods A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted to compare the relative efficacy of gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and osimertinib in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. To assess the cost-effectiveness of these treatments, a Markov model was developed from Dutch societal perspective. The model was based on the clinical studies included in the NMA. Incremental costs per life-year (LY) and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were estimated. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted. Results Total discounted per patient costs for gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and osimertinib were euro65,889, euro64,035, euro69,418, and euro131,997, and mean QALYs were 1.36, 1.39, 1.52, and 2.01 per patient, respectively. Erlotinib dominated gefitinib. Afatinib versus erlotinib yielded incremental costs of euro27,058/LY and euro41,504/QALY gained. Osimertinib resulted in euro91,726/LY and euro128,343/QALY gained compared to afatinib. PSA showed that gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and osimertinib had 13%, 19%, 43%, and 26% probability to be cost-effective at a threshold of euro80,000/QALY. A price reduction of osimertinib of 30% is required for osimertinib to be cost-effective at a threshold of euro80,000/QALY. Conclusions Osimertinib has a better effectiveness compared to all other TKIs. However, at a Dutch threshold of euro80,000/QALY, osimertinib appears not to be cost-effective.",Osimertinib,Health Care Sciences & Services

This study examines the external validity of such preferences, unravels its determinants, and provides evidence of whether healthcare choice is predictable. We focused on influenza vaccination and used a six-step approach: i) literature study, ii) expert interviews, iii) focus groups, iv) survey including a DCE, v) field data, and vi) in-depth interviews with respondents who showed discordance between stated choices and actual healthcare utilization. Respondents without missing values in the survey and the actual healthcare utilization (377/499 = 76%) were included in the analyses. Random-utility-maximization and random-regretminimization models were used to analyze the DCE data, whereas the in-depth interviews combined five scientific theories to explain discordance. When models took into account both scale and preference heterogeneity, real-world choices to opt for influenza vaccination were correctly predicted by DCE at an aggregate level, and 91% of choices were correctly predicted at an individual level. There was 13% (49/377) discordance between stated choices and actual healthcare utilization. In-depth interviews showed that several dimensions played a role in clarifying this discordance: attitude, social support, action of planning, barriers, and intention. Evidence was found that our DCE yields accurate actual healthcare choice predictions if at least scale and preference heterogeneity are taken into account. Analysis of discordant subjects showed that we can even do better. The DCE measures an important part of preferences by focusing on attribute tradeoffs that people make in their decision to participate in a healthcare intervention. Inhibitors may be among these attributes, but it is more likely that inhibitors have to do with exogenous factors lik e goals, religion, and social norms. Con-ducting upfront work on constraints/inhibitors of the focal behavior, not just what promotes the behavior, might further improve predictive ability.",Healthcare choice,Biomedical Social Sciences

We examined the diagnostic and treatment strategies in patients with known or suspected ACS as reported by physicians and identified variations in responses across European countries and geographical areas. Method A web-based clinician survey focusing on ACS imaging and revascularization treatments was circulated through email distribution lists and websites of European professional societies in the field of cardiology. We collected information on respondents' clinical setting and specialty. Reported percentages of patients receiving imaging or treatment modalities and percentages of clinicians reporting to use modalities in a range of clinical scenarios were analyzed. Statistical comparisons were performed. Results In total, 69 responses were received (Sweden [n = 20], United Kingdom [n = 16], Northern/Western Europe [n = 17], Southern Europe [n = 9], and Central Europe [n = 7]). Considerable variations between geographical areas were seen in terms of reported diagnostic modalities and treatment strategies. For example, when presented with the scenario of a theoretical 45-year-old smoking female with a suspected ACS, 56% of UK clinicians reported to use coronary computed tomography angiography, compared to only 10% of Swedish clinicians (P = .002). Large variations were observed regarding the reported use of fractional flow reserve by physicians for non-culprit lesions during invasive management of myocardial infarction patients (44% in Sweden, 31% in the United Kingdom, and 30% in Northern/Western Europe vs non-use in Central and Southern Europe). Conclusions In this survey, respondents reported different diagnostic and treatment strategies in ACS care. These variations seem to have geographic components. Larger studies or real world data are needed to verify these observations and investigate their causes. More research is needed to compare the quality and efficiency of ACS care across countries and explore pathways for improvement.",revascularization treatment,General & Internal Medicine

This article draws on Habermas' distinction between 'lifeworld' and 'system' to explore patient-safety culture in medical residency training. Sociological accounts of medical training have indicated that applying systemic solutions in patient-safety training and practice may conflict with residents' needs. Residents would navigate safety systems to get their work done and safeguard learning opportunities, acting 'in between' the system and traditional processes of socialisation and learning on the job. Our ethnographic study reveals how residents seek to connect system and professional-based learning, and do them together in situated manners that evolve in the course of medical training. We reveal three themes that closely align with the residents' developmental process of maturing during training and on the job to become 'real' physicians: (1) coming to grips with the job; (2) working around safety procedures; and (3) moving on to independence. A more explicit focus on learning to deal with uncertainty may enable residents to become more skilled in balancing safety systems.",The Netherlands,Biomedical Social Sciences

An assessment using Dutch administrative data,"The Netherlands is one of the few countries that offer generous universal public coverage of long-term care (LTC). Does this ensure that the Dutch elderly with similar care needs receive similar LTC, irrespective of their income? In contrast with previous studies of inequity in care use that relied on a statistically derived variable of needs, our paper exploits a readily available, administrative measure of LTC needs stemming from the eligibility assessment organized by the Dutch LTC assessment agency. Using exhaustive administrative register data on 616,934 individuals aged 60 and older eligible for public LTC, we find a substantial pro-poor concentration of LTC use that is only partially explained by poorer individuals' greater needs. Among those eligible for institutional care, higher-income individuals are more likely to use-less costly-home care. This pattern may be explained by differences in preferences, but also by their higher copayments for nursing homes and by greater feasibility of home-based LTC arrangements for richer elderly. At face value, our findings suggest that the Dutch LTC insurance ""overshoots"" its target to ensure that LTC is accessible to poorer elderly. Yet, the implications depend on the origins of the difference and one's normative stance.",socioeconomic inequality,Health Care Sciences & Services

In 2008, we conducted a systematic review to provide an overview of the scientific studies focused on these interventions. However, over the past decade, the literature on team interventions has rapidly evolved. An updated overview is therefore required, and it will focus on all possible team interventions without restrictions to a type of intervention, setting, or research design. Objectives To review the literature from the past decade on interventions with the goal of improving team effectiveness within healthcare organizations and identify the ""evidence base"" levels of the research. Methods Seven major databases were systematically searched for relevant articles published between 2008 and July 2018. Of the original search yield of 6025 studies, 297 studies met the inclusion criteria according to three independent authors and were subsequently included for analysis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Scale was used to assess the level of empirical evidence. Results Three types of interventions were distinguished: (1) Training, which is sub-divided into training that is based on predefined principles (i.e. CRM: crew resource management and TeamSTEPPS: Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety), on a specific method (i.e. simulation), or on general team training. (2) Tools covers tools that structure (i.e. SBAR: Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation, (de)briefing checklists, and rounds), facilitate (through communication technology), or trigger (through monitoring and feedback) teamwork. (3) Organizational (re)design is about (re)designing structures to stimulate team processes and team functioning. (4) A programme is a combination of the previous types. The majority of studies evaluated a training focused on the (acute) hospital care setting. Most of the evaluated interventions focused on improving non-technical skills and provided evidence of improvements. Conclusion Over the last decade, the number of studies on team interventions has increased exponentially. At the same time, research tends to focus on certain interventions, settings, and/or outcomes. Principle-based training (i.e. CRM and TeamSTEPPS) and simulation-based training seem to provide the greatest opportunities for reaching the improvement goals in team functioning.",Team performance,Business & Economics

Patients' utilization of healthcare leads to costs to society. The results of the study can be used in future economic evaluations of treatments for hip fractures. Purpose Hip fractures are associated with high mortality, reduced quality of life, and increased healthcare utilization, leading to an economic burden to society. The purpose of this study is to determine the burden of illness of hip fractures in elderly Dutch patients for specific time periods after surgery. Methods Patients with a hip fracture above the age of 65 were included in the study. In the 1-year period after surgery, patients were asked to complete a set of questionnaires pre-injury (retrospectively), and 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after surgery. The set of questionnaires included the Euroqol 5D (EQ-5D-3L), the iMTA Medical Consumption Questionnaire (iMCQ) and iMTA Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ). Health-related quality of life was calculated using Dutch tariffs. Costs were calculated using the methodology described in the Dutch costing manual. Results Approximately 20% of patients with a hip fracture died within 1 year. Health-related quality of life was significantly reduced compared to pre-injury values, and patients did not recover to their pre-injury values within 1 year. Total costs in the first year after injury were euro27,573, of which 10% were due to costs of the procedure (euro2706). Total follow-up costs (euro24,876) were predominantly consisting of healthcare costs. Monthly costs decreased over time. Conclusions Hip fractures lead to a burden to patients, resulting from mortality and health-related quality of life reductions, and to society, due to (healthcare) costs. The results of this study can be used in future economic evaluations.",Health-related quality of life,Orthopedics

Policymakers' use of 'evidence' is presumed to pertain to ideals of justice in decision-making. However, according to some, EBM is liable to generate 'epistemic injustice' because it prefers quantitative types of evidence and - as a result of that - potentially undervalues the qualitative testimonies of doctors and patients. Miranda Fricker's concept of 'epistemic injustice' refers to a wrong done to a person in their capacity as a knower. This paper explores the usefulness and limits of this concept in the context of public decision-making. How is evidence-based policymaking intertwined with questions of 'epistemic injustice'? Drawing from ethnographic research conducted at the National Health Care Institute, we analyze two cases of EBM-inspired policy practices in Dutch social health insurance: 1) the use of the principles of EBM in making a public reimbursement decision, and 2) private insurers' use of quantitative performance indicators for the practice of selective contracting on the Dutch healthcare market. While the concept of 'epistemic injustice' misses some key processes involved in understanding how 'knowing gets done' in public policy, it does shed new light on priority-setting processes. Patients or medical professionals who are not duly recognized as credible and intelligible epistemic agents, subsequently, lack the social power to influence priority-setting practices. They are thus not merely frustrated in their capacity to be heard and make themselves understood, they are potentially deprived of a fair share in collective financial and medical resources. If we fail to recognize inequalities in credibility and intelligibility between diverse groups of knowers, there is a chance that these epistemic inequalities are being reproduced in our system of health insurance and our ways of distributing healthcare provisions.",Health insurance,Biomedical Social Sciences

An interpretive systematic umbrella review of tools in healthcare,"IntroductionA toxic organisational culture (OC) is a major contributing factor to serious failings in healthcare delivery. Poor OC with its consequences of unprofessional behaviour, unsafe attitudes of professionals and its impact on patient care still need to be addressed. Although various tools have been developed to determine OC and improve patient safety, it remains a challenge to decide on the suitability of tools for uncovering the underlying factors which truly impact OC, such as behavioural norms, or the unwritten rules. A better understanding of the underlying dimensions that these tools do and do not unravel is required.ObjectivesThe aim of this study is to provide an overview of existing tools to assess OC and the tangible and intangible OC dimensions these tools address.MethodsAn interpretive umbrella review was conducted. Literature reviews were considered for inclusion if they described multiple tools and their dimensional characteristics in the context of OC, organisational climate, patient safety culture or climate. OC tools and the underlying dimensions were extracted from the reviews. A qualitative data analysis software program (MAX.QDA 2007) was used for coding the dimensions, which resulted in tangible and intangible themes.ResultsFifteen reviews met our inclusion criteria. A total of 127 tools were identified, which were mainly quantitative questionnaires covering tangible key dimensions. Qualitative analyses distinguished nine intangible themes (commitment, trust, psychological safety, power, support, communication openness, blame and shame, morals and valuing ethics, and cohesion) and seven tangible themes (leadership, communication system, teamwork, training and development, organisational structures and processes, employee and job attributes, and patient orientation).ConclusionThis umbrella review identifies the essential tangible and intangible themes of OC tools. OC tools in healthcare do not seem to be designed to determine deeper underlying dimensions of culture. We suggest approaching complex underlying OC problems by focusing on the intangible dimensions, rather than putting the tangible dimensions up front.",health policy,General & Internal Medicine

Economic evaluation can be a helpful tool to inform resource allocation in publicly financed systems. Such evaluations frequently use health-related outcome measures. However, in areas such as care of older people, improving health outcomes is not necessarily the main focus of care interventions and broader outcome measures, including outcomes for those providing informal care, may be preferred when evaluating such interventions. This paper validates a recently introduced well-being measure, the ICECAP-O, in a population of informal carers for people with dementia from eight European countries. Methods Convergent and discriminant validity tests were performed to validate the ICECAP-O using data obtained in a sample of 451 respondents from Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the UK. These respondents completed a number of standardized questionnaires within the framework of the Actifcare project. Results The ICECAP-O performed well among informal carers, in terms of both convergent and discriminant validity. In the multivariate analysis, it was found to be significantly associated with the age of the person with dementia, EQ-5D-5L health problem index of the person with dementia, carer-patient relationship, care recipient CDR, carer LSNS Score, the PAI score, and Perseverance Time. Conclusion The ICECAP-O appears to be a valid measure of well-being in informal carers for people with dementia. The ICECAP-O may therefore be useful as an outcome measure in economic evaluations of interventions aimed at such informal carers, when these aim to improve well-being beyond health.",Well-being,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Design A qualitative evidence synthesis with a framework analysis. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Rx for Change databases until September 2018 were searched. Eligibility criteria We included studies that primarily focused on identifying factors influencing de-implementation or the continuation of low-value care, and studies describing influencing factors related to the effect of a de-implementation strategy. Data extraction and synthesis The factors were classified on five levels: individual provider, individual patient, social context, organisational context, economic/political context. Results We identified 333 factors in 81 articles. Factors related to the individual provider (n=131; 74% barriers, 17% facilitators, 9% both barrier/facilitator) were associated with their attitude (n=72; 55%), knowledge/skills (n=43; 33%), behaviour (n=11; 8%) and provider characteristics (n=5; 4%). Individual patient factors (n=58; 72% barriers, 9% facilitators, 19% both barrier/facilitator) were mainly related to knowledge (n=33; 56%) and attitude (n=13; 22%). Factors related to the social context (n=46; 41% barriers, 48% facilitators, 11% both barrier/facilitator) included mainly professional teams (n=23; 50%) and professional development (n=12; 26%). Frequent factors in the organisational context (n=67; 67% barriers, 25% facilitators, 8% both barrier/facilitator) were available resources (n=28; 41%) and organisational structures and work routines (n=24; 36%). Under the category of economic and political context (n=31; 71% barriers, 13% facilitators, 16% both barrier/facilitator), financial incentives were most common (n=27; 87%). Conclusions This study provides in-depth insight into the factors within the different (sub)categories that are important in reducing low-value care. This can be used to identify barriers and facilitators in low-value care practices or to stimulate development of strategies that need further refinement. We conclude that multifaceted de-implementation strategies are often necessary for effective reduction of low-value care. Situation-specific knowledge of impeding or facilitating factors across all levels is important for designing tailored de-implementation strategies.",organisation of health services,General & Internal Medicine

'Study protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial' (SUSPECT study),"Introduction Some scaphoid fractures become visible on radiographs weeks after a trauma which makes normal radiographs directly after trauma unreliable. Untreated scaphoid fractures can lead to scaphoid non-union progressing to osteoarthritis. Therefore, the general treatment for patients with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture and normal initial radiographs is immobilisation with below-elbow cast for 2 weeks. However, most of these patients are treated unnecessarily because eventually less than 10% of them are diagnosed with an occult scaphoid fracture. To reduce overtreatment and costs as a result of unnecessary cast treatment in patients with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture and normal initial radiographs, we designed a study to compare below-elbow cast treatment with supportive bandage treatment. We hypothesise that the functional outcome after 3 months is not inferior in patients treated with supportive bandage compared to patients treated with below-elbow cast, but with lower costs in the supportive bandage group. Methods and analysis The SUSPECT study is an open-labelled multicentre randomised controlled trial with non-inferiority design. A total of 180 adult patients with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture and normal initial radiographs are randomised between two groups: 3 days of supportive bandage or 2 weeks of below-elbow cast. We aim to evaluate the functional outcome and cost-effectiveness of both treatments. The primary outcome is the functional outcome after 3 months, assessed with the Quick Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score. Secondary outcomes include functional outcome, recovery of function, pain, patient satisfaction, quality of life and cost-effectiveness measured by medical consumption, absence from work or decreased productivity. Ethics and dissemination The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus MC Medical Centre, Rotterdam, approved the study protocol (MEC-2017-504). We plan to present the results after completion of the study at (inter)national conferences and publish in general peer-reviewed journals.",accident & emergency medicine,General & Internal Medicine

Design Multicentre observational study. Setting Fifty medical departments at 14 (academic and non-academic) hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants Four hundred sixty-five physicians (71.6% response rate), comprising 385 (82.8%) medical specialists and 80 (17.2%) residents. Main outcome measures Job demands (workload and bureaucratic demands), job resources (participation in decision making, development opportunities, leader's inspiration, relationships with colleagues and patients)-measured with the validated Questionnaire of Experience and Evaluation of Work and Physician Worklife Survey-and patient-related burnout, measured using the validated Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Results Patient-related burnout was positively associated with workload (b=0.36; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.48; p<0.001) and negatively associated with development opportunities (b=-0.18; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.08; p<0.001) and relationships with patients (b=-0.12; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.03; p=0.01). Relationships with patients moderated the association between bureaucratic demands and patient-related burnout (b=-0.15; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.04; p=0.01). Conclusions Physicians with high workloads and few development opportunities reported higher levels of patient-related burnout. Those with positive patient relationships were less likely to experience patient-related burnout, even in the presence of excessive bureaucracy. Therefore, positive physician-patient relationships may be supported to reduce the likelihood of physicians' patient-related burnout. However, the specific support needed to effectively reduce patient-related burnout may vary per healthcare context and thus requires intensified research across healthcare systems and settings.",medical education & training,General & Internal Medicine

As yet, there is a lack of research into using CATA to analyze responses to open survey questions and constructing text-based measures of psychological constructs. In our study, we demonstrated the potential of CATA methods for the construction of text-based job satisfaction measures based on responses to a completely open and semi-open question. To do this, we employed three sentiment analysis techniques: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015, SentimentR and SentiStrength, and quantified the forms of measurement error they introduced: specific factor error, algorithm error and transient error. We conducted an initial test of the text-based measures validity, assessing their convergence with closed-question job satisfaction measures. We adopted a time-lagged survey design (N-wave (1) = 996; N-wave 2 = 116) to test our hypotheses. In line with our hypotheses, we found that specific factor error is higher in the open question text-based measure than in the semi-open question text-based measure. As expected, algorithm error was substantial for both the open and semi-open question text-based measures. Transient error in the text-based measures was higher than expected, as it generally exceeded the transient error in the human-coded and the closed job satisfaction question measures. Our initial test of convergent and discriminant validity indicated that the semi-open question text-based measure is especially suitable for measuring job satisfaction.

Alarmingly, burned-out doctors are more likely to exhibit low levels of professionalism and provide suboptimal patient care. Research suggests that burnout and the well-being of doctors can be improved by mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). Furthermore, MBIs may improve doctors' performance (eg in empathy). However, there are no published systematic reviews that clarify the effects of MBIs on doctor well-being or performance to inform future research and professional development programmes. We therefore systematically reviewed and narratively synthesised findings on the impacts of MBIs on doctors' well-being and performance. Methods We searched PubMed and PsycINFO from inception to 9 May 2018 and independently reviewed studies investigating the effects of MBIs on doctor well-being or performance. We systematically extracted data and assessed study quality according to the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI), and narratively reported study findings. Results We retrieved a total of 934 articles, of which 24 studies met our criteria; these included randomised, (un)controlled or qualitative studies of average quality. Effects varied across MBIs with different training contents or formats: MBIs including essential mindfulness training elements, or employing group-based training, mostly showed positive effects on the well-being or performance of doctors across different educational and hospital settings. Doctors perceived both benefits (enhanced self- and other-understanding) and challenges (time limitations and feasibility) associated with MBIs. Findings were subject to the methodological limitations of studies (eg the use of self-selected participants, lack of placebo interventions, use of self-reported outcomes). Conclusions This review indicates that doctors can perceive positive impacts of MBIs on their well-being and performance. However, the evidence was subject to methodological limitations and does not yet support the standardisation of MBIs in professional development programmes. Rather, health care organisations could consider including group-based MBIs as voluntary modules for doctors with specific well-being needs or ambitions regarding professional development.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

Even a currently positive situation is hard to bear when we know the future will be grim. Indeed, previous research has found that more hopeful people are happier. However, both hope and subjective well-being are multidimensional concepts comprising emotion (i.e., anticipation and affect), cognition (expectation and satisfaction) and, to some degree, motivation. Since most studies include only one dimension of hope and subjective well-being, little is known about how different aspects of hope relate to different aspects of subjective well-being. This study aims to gain insight into these relationships by providing an overview of the existing empirical literature on hope and subjective well-being. Subsequently, cross-sectional data of a representative sample of the American population are used to further examine the relationship between hope and subjective well-being. Our findings from both the literature and our empirical analysis show that positive expectations are only weakly associated with all domains of subjective well-being, whereas cognitive and emotional hope are most strongly related to subjective well-being. This finding indicates that the more passive characteristics of positive expectations have less of an impact on subjective well-being than a more agentic hopeful disposition.",Affect,Social Sciences - Other Topics

Methods: Two literature reviews and semi-structured interviews (n = 143) with healthcare stakeholders in Europe and the US were conducted; results of these informed the design of focus group guides. Eight focus groups were conducted with European patients, industry representatives and regulators, and with US regulators and European/Canadian health technology assessment (HTA) representatives. Focus groups were analyzed thematically using NVivo. Results: Stakeholder perspectives on how PPS should be designed and conducted were as follows: 1) study design should be informed by the research questions and patient population; 2) preferred treatment attributes and levels, as well as trade-offs among attributes and levels should be investigated; 3) the patient sample and method should match the MPLC phase; 4) different stakeholders should collaborate; and 5) results from PPS should be shared with relevant stakeholders. The value of patient preferences in decision-making was found to increase with the level of patient preference sensitivity of decisions on medical products. Stakeholders mentioned that patient preferences are hardly used in current decision-making. Potential applications for patient preferences across industry, regulatory and HTA processes were identified. Four applications seemed most promising for systematic integration of patient preferences: 1) benefit-risk assessment by industry and regulators at the marketing-authorization phase; 2) assessment of major contribution to patient care by European regulators; 3) cost-effectiveness analysis; and 4) multi criteria decision analysis in HTA. Conclusions: The value of patient preferences for decision-making depends on the level of collaboration across stakeholders; the match between the research question, MPLC phase, sample, and preference method used in PPS; and the sensitivity of the decision regarding a medical product to patient preferences. Promising applications for patient preferences should be further explored with stakeholders to optimize their inclusion in decision-making.",marketing authorization,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Background To meet today's challenges of the increasing healthcare demands, the employment of NPs is proliferating. NPs have the ideal position to play a pivotal role within healthcare reforms, yet full expansion of their scope of practice and expertise is having limited success. Long-term sustainability of NPs depends on the ability to perform and develop a leading role. Design and methods This qualitative descriptive study was conducted in fifteen Dutch hospitals. Data were collected from April-July 2018, and purposive sampling was used for eighteen semi-structured interviews. This study is conducted and reported according to the COREQ checklist. Results Three main themes concerning NPs' current leadership role emerged, and they were all linked to a successful positioning of NPs. All themes seemed to be of influence on NPs' scope of daily practice. Direct patient care was emphasised, and leadership on other levels appeared to be underused. Most NPs desired to reshape their profession. However, unprofitable use of their leadership skills especially on professional and organisational level and lack of supportive factors seemed to hinder them. Conclusions An adequate use of leadership is crucial for role development and positioning of NPs. Further development of the NP profession can help to better differentiate between the tasks of registered specialised nurses and NPs. Relevance to clinical practice Leadership in nursing contributes to the improvement of the quality and efficiency of health care. Further positioning of the NP profession depends on a profitable use of leadership competencies. Besides, NPs should collaborate with healthcare organisations, educational institutions and professional associations to value the NP profession in the current healthcare system.",registered specialised nurse,Nursing

First, the framing of cell site deployment among citizens closely resembles the frames in policy. Second, following the depoliticization of cell phone health risks, the absence of alarming health effects and the withering of public debate, a stable three quarter of citizens seems unconcerned for a couple of years, while an equally stable quarter reports health worries. This stability is in line with the stabilized dominant policy discourse. Third, on an individual and local level, we do find some changes in citizens' risk perception, framings, feelings and - albeit very limited, actions. These changes can partly be traced to local siting procedures.

The purpose of this paper is to study the characteristics of a range of on-demand services in order to better understand the meaning of ""on-demand"" and its implications for service management. This enables the on-demand service logic to be applied to other service contexts, where it may add value for customers. Design/methodology/approach The study starts with a focused literature review and continues with a multiple case study methodology, as the on-demand service concept is in the early stages of theory development. Seven cases were studied, based on a maximum variation sampling strategy. Findings The results show that on-demand services are characterized by three interrelated characteristics: being highly available, responsive and scalable. Analysis further reveals that on-demand services display differences within the conceptual boundaries of these characteristics, i.e. they vary in terms of their availability, responsiveness and scalability. Originality/value Drawing on these findings, the study contributes to the service literature by being the first to specifically conceptualize and define the on-demand services concept and reveal three key characteristics that clarify the distinctive nature of this service type. Accordingly, on-demand services are clearly differentiated from other services. Additionally, the paper discusses the variety within on-demand services and develops an on-demand service continuum that gives detailed insights into the conceptual variations within such services.",Access economy,Business & Economics

In this article, we study a policy change in the Netherlands that aims to encourage organisations to learn more from incidents. Dutch healthcare organisations investigate their own incidents. Recently, the Dutch government decided that when an incident leads to the death of a client in elderly or disabled care, an external chair should head the investigation committee. Thinking of learning as social, participative practice, we asked how and under what conditions an external chair might help organisations learn from incidents. We adopted a qualitative research design. We asked healthcare inspectors to assess 20 incident investigation reports by committees with (10) and without an external chair (10), using what we learned in follow-up interviews and a focus group. We interviewed investigation committee chairs, professionals involved in incidents, quality advisers and directors of four healthcare organisations (n = 15) to study how they investigated incidents with external chairs. We also interviewed external chairs, healthcare inspectors and other stakeholders (n = 15). Our respondents valued external chairs' methodological expertise and experience in investigating incidents. The external chair's outsider's position enables critical, impartial inquiry. Besides helping organisations identify root causes of an incident, both external chairs and organisations learn from investigating an incident. Our article contributes to literature on (shared) learning from incidents by envisioning of the external chair as fostering a social and participative form of shared learning.",Shared learning,Operations Research & Management Science

Rather than focusing on how standards affect regulated practices and organizations, our study examines how the use of these instruments affects the standard maker, that is, the Inspectorate. We explore how the Inspectorate's work practices, standards, and coupled performance measurement system influence its regulatory pedagogy, reviewing practices, and decisionmaking. We conclude that standards and performance measurement systems are not by definition ""instruments of control"" as their constitutive effects are (under)determined by the relationships in which they are enacted.",standards,Public Administration

Because of their condition it is not possible to ask for the patients' informed consent to be enrolled in observational research at the point of admission to the hospital. Often this is not possible at a later moment either. Yet informed consent is the baseline to be enrolled in research with personal data and exceptions must be allowed for by national legislation. This was the case under Directive 95/96/EC and will be the case under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, Regulation 2016/679 EU) which will replace the Directive from 25 May 2018 onwards. Though being a Regulation and therefore directly applicable in the Member States, the long debate about the research exceptions in the GDPR left many aspects of observational research including the exception to the informed consent principle, mainly to the Member States. It may be assumed that most Member States will leave their present state of the law intact in this respect as that was part of the political compromise. We compared existing national privacy legislation from the perspective of critical care research and found great variation. Although this may not impede the collection of emergency and critical care research with data without prior informed consent in countries which are more responsive to such research, it might be a challenge to exchange such data from the national nodes in European wide research collaboration. We make a case that countries which are not responsive to such research should adapt their legislation in the interests of future critical care patients.",679 (GDPR),Legal Medicine

Scenarios were assessed to find the relative impact of critical parameters on incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Methods A partitioned survival model was constructed comparing acalabrutinib and ibrutinib from a UK national health service perspective. This model included states for progression-free survival (PFS), post-progression survival (PPS) and death. PFS and overall survival (OS) were parametrically extrapolated from ibrutinib publications and a preliminary hazard ratio based on phase I/II data was applied for acalabrutinib. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, and 1296 scenarios were assessed. Results The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 61,941 pound/QALY, with 3.44 incremental QALYs and incremental costs of 213,339 pound. Deterministic sensitivity analysis indicated that survival estimates, utilities and treatment costs of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib and resource use during PFS have the greatest influence on the ICER. Probabilistic results under different development scenarios indicated that greater efficacy of acalabrutinib would decrease the likelihood of cost effectiveness (from 63% at no effect to 2% at maximum efficacy). Scenario analyses showed that a reduction in PFS did not lead to great QALY differences (- 8 to - 14% incremental QALYs) although it did greatly affect costs (- 47 to - 122% incremental pounds). For OS, the opposite was true (- 89 to - 93% QALYs and - 7 to - 39% pounds). Conclusions Acalabrutinib is not likely to be cost effective compared with ibrutinib under current development scenarios. The conflicting effects of OS, PFS, drug costs and utility during PFS show that determining the cost effectiveness of acalabrutinib without insight into all parameters complicates health technology assessment decision making. Early assessment of the cost effectiveness of new products can support development choices and reimbursement processes through effective early dialogues between stakeholders.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

The clinical efficacy of remote monitoring of pulmonary artery (PA) pressures (CardioMEMS; Abbott Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA) has been demonstrated in the USA. Currently, the PA sensor is not reimbursed in the European Union as its benefit when applied in addition to standard HF care is unknown in Western European countries, including the Netherlands. Aims To demonstrate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of haemodynamic PA monitoring in addition to contemporary standard HF care in a high-quality Western European health care system. Methods The current study is a prospective, multi-centre, randomised clinical trial in 340 patients with chronic HF (New York Heart Association functional class III) randomised to HF care including remote monitoring with the CardioMEMS PA sensor or standard HF care alone. Eligible patients have at least one hospitalisation for HF in 12 months before enrolment and will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Minimum follow-up will be 1 year. The primary endpoint is the change in QoL as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). Secondary endpoints are the number of HF hospital admissions and changes in health status assessed by EQ-5D-5L questionnaire including health care utilisation and formal cost-effectiveness analysis. Conclusion The MONITOR HF trial will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of haemodynamic monitoring by CardioMEMS in addition to standard HF care in patients with chronic HF.

This study aimed to answer the following questions: (a) What is the perceived quality of township health centres (THCs) under integration? (B) What differences could be observed among the three typical integration models, namely, private hospital-THC integration, public hospital-THC integration, and loose collaboration? Two rounds of cross-sectional surveys were conducted from November 2016 to June 2018. The Chinese version of the Primary Care Assessment Tool was used to evaluate perceived quality of sample THCs, and 1118 adult patients were interviewed in total. Multiple linear regressions were employed to compare the quality scores between two survey rounds and among different integration models after controlling for potential confounders. The results revealed that the quality of care significantly improved under private hospital-THC integration as observed by comparing two survey rounds, while no change or slight changes were observed in the other two models. The difference observed among the three models was that the perceived quality of THCs integrated with private hospitals was worse than that of THCs integrated with public hospitals and THCs under loose collaboration, while no significant difference was observed between public hospital-THC integration and loose collaboration. Increased attention should be given to highlighting the tight integration between hospitals and THCs and the different roles played by private and public hospitals in the current reform.",township health centres,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Patient-Centred Care (PCC) may help organizations to support these patients according to their needs and so improve the quality of care. PCC has been shown to consist of eight dimensions, including for instance access to care and continuity of care, but these eight dimensions may not be equally important in all care settings and to all patients. Furthermore, the views of those involved in care provision may affect the choices they make concerning care and support to patients. Therefore, insight into how professionals and volunteers involved in palliative care delivery view PCC is important for understanding and improving the quality of care in the palliative sector.MethodsThis study was conducted in the palliative care setting (hospices and hospitals) in the Netherlands. Views on palliative care were investigated using the Q-methodology. Participants were asked to rank 35 statements that represented the eight dimensions of PCC in palliative care settings, and to explain their ranking during a follow-up interview. Ranking data were analysed using by-person factor analysis. Interview materials were used to help interpret the resulting factors.ResultsThe analysis revealed two distinct viewpoints on PCC in palliative care: 'The patient in the driver seat', particularly emphasizing the importance of patient autonomy during the last phase of life, and 'The patient in the passenger seat', focussed on the value of coordination between professionals, volunteers and patients.ConclusionsThe most distinguishing aspect between views on PCC in palliative care concerned control; a preference for the patient in the driver's seat versus shared decision-making by a team consisting of patient, professionals and volunteers. Different types of care and support may be most adequate to satisfy the different needs and preferences of patients with either of these views.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

The research includes over 120 h of observation, 41 semi-structured interviews and 2 focus groups. Findings The research shows that rebels' quality practices are an emerging set of collaborative activities to improving healthcare and meeting (individual) patient needs. They conduct ""contexting work"" to achieve their quality aims by expanding their normative work to outside domains. As rebels deviate from hospital policies, they are sometimes forced to act ""under the radar"" causing the risk of groupthink and may undermine the aim of public accounting.

We collected data using digital surveys in a cluster-randomized cross-sectional cohort study. The sample entailed 1211 household members from 25 randomly selected villages within two subcounties, of a rural West-Ugandan district. The association between five validated sexual and reproductive health outcome indicators and exposure to community health entrepreneurship was assessed using wealth-adjusted mixed-effects logistic regression models. We observed that households living in an area where community health entrepreneurs were active reported more often to use at least one modern contraceptive method [odds ratios (OR): 2.01, 95% CI: 1.30-3.10] had more knowledge of modern contraceptive methods (OR: 7.75, 95% CI: 2.81-21.34), knew more sexually transmitted infections (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.14-3.05), and mentioned more symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.18-2.85). The association between exposure to community health entrepreneurship and communities' comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS was more ambiguous (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 0.97-1.67). To conclude, households living in areas where community health entrepreneurs were active had higher odds on using modern contraceptives and had more knowledge of modern contraceptive methods, sexually transmitted infections and symptoms of sexually transmitted infections. This study provides the first evidence supporting the role of community health entrepreneurship in providing rural communities with sexual and reproductive health care.",sexual and reproductive health,Health Care Sciences & Services

We aimed to research the functioning of a TC for young people with CF compared with direct hand-over care and to evaluate whether those treated at the TC have better transfer experiences and outcomes compared with the control group. Methods Mixed-methods retrospective controlled design, including interviews with professionals, observations of clinics, chart reviews (at four measurement moments), and patient surveys. Qualitative data analysis focused on organization and daily routines, and barriers and facilitators experienced. Young people's transfer experiences, self-management, health care use, and clinical outcomes were assessed quantitatively. Results The most notable feature distinguishing the TC and direct hand-over care comprised joint consultations between pediatric and adult care professionals in the former. A transition coordinator was considered essential for the success of the TC. The main barriers were lack of time, planning, and reimbursement issues. Young people treated at the TC tended to have better transfer experiences and were more satisfied. They reported significantly more trust in their adult care professionals. Their self-management-related outcomes were less favorable. Conclusions The TC had several perceived benefits and showed positive trends in transfer experiences and satisfaction, but no differences in health-related outcomes. Structured preparation of young people, joint consultations with pediatric and adult care professionals, and better coordination were perceived as facilitating elements.

We investigate whether the benefits of increased volume through pooling patients outweigh the disadvantages of increased heterogeneity and pursue our analysis in the context of neonatal care. Our empirical studies relies on 4020 patient episodes collected in 18 German neonatal intensive care units and we distinguish between two patient clusters that differ with respect to the inherent medical risk and operational heterogeneity. Cluster 1 consists of very-low birth weight (VLBW) infants with increased risk of complications but similar service trajectories and lower operational heterogeneity. Cluster 2 contains non-VLBW infants with lower risk of complications but more diversity in disease patterns and higher operational heterogeneity. Our analysis shows that cluster volume, that is, the unit's absolute patient volume in a cluster, is positively related to process outcomes as indicated by decreasing length of stay. This relationship is found for both clusters. Regarding focus, we do not find any evidence of positive effects. In fact, we even find that cluster focus, that is, the unit's relative volume of the cluster, is detrimentally related to process outcomes for non-VLBW patients with lower risk of complications and more operational heterogeneity. This indicates that organizational units providing services for complex patients should not have a narrow focus, but should rather provide services for related patient clusters in order to achieve higher volume levels within the unit.",neonatal intensive care,Operations Research & Management Science

This review aimed to understand the potential roles, reasons for using PP and the expectations, concerns and requirements associated with PP in industry processes, regulatory benefit-risk assessment (BRA) and marketing authorization (MA), and HTA and reimbursement decision-making. Methods A systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature published between January 2011 and March 2018 was performed. Consulted databases were EconLit, Embase, Guidelines International Network, PsycINFO and PubMed. A two-step strategy was used to select literature. Literature was analyzed using NVivo (QSR international). Results From 1015 initially identified documents, 72 were included. Most were written from an academic perspective (61%) and focused on PP in BRA/MA and/or HTA/reimbursement (73%). Using PP to improve understanding of patients' valuations of treatment outcomes, patients' benefit-risk trade-offs and preference heterogeneity were roles identified in all three decision-making contexts. Reasons for using PP relate to the unique insights and position of patients and the positive effect of including PP on the quality of the decision-making process. Concerns shared across decision-making contexts included methodological questions concerning the validity, reliability and cognitive burden of preference methods. In order to use PP, general, operational and quality requirements were identified, including recognition of the importance of PP and ensuring patient understanding in PP studies. Conclusions Despite the array of opportunities and added value of using PP throughout the different steps of the MPLC identified in this review, their inclusion in decision-making is hampered by methodological challenges and lack of specific guidance on how to tackle these challenges when undertaking PP studies. To support the development of such guidance, more best practice PP studies and PP studies investigating the methodological issues identified in this review are critically needed.",Reimbursement,Medical Informatics

It is important to evaluate whether digital health services contribute to health system goals in an optimal way. This should be done at the level of the service, not the 'digital transformation'. Decisions to adopt new digital health services, at different levels of the health care system, are ideally based on evidence regarding their performance in light of health system goals. In order to evaluate this, a broad perspective should be taken in evaluations of digital health services. Attainment of the broad health system goals, including quality, efficiency and equity, are objectives against which to judge new digital health services. These goals in a broad sense are unaltered by the process of digitalization. Governance should be designed and tailored in such a way to capture all relevant changes in an adequate way. When evaluating digital health services many specific aspects need to be considered. Like for other innovations and (new) technologies, such promises may or may not materialize and potential benefits may also be accompanied by unintended and/or negative (side) effects in the short or long term. Hence, the introduction, implementation, use and funding of digital health technologies should be carefully evaluated and monitored. Governments should play a more active role in the further optimization both of the process of decision making (both at the central and decentral level) and the related outcomes. They need to find a balance between centralized and decentralized activity. Moreover, the broader preparation of the health care system to be able to deal with digitalization, from education, through financial and regulatory preconditions, to implementation of monitoring systems to monitor its effects on health system performance remains important.",,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Qualitative fieldwork was conducted in eight co-housing communities in the Netherlands, consisting of document analysis, interviews, focus groups, and observations. The research shows that co-housing communities offer social contacts, social control, and instrumental and emotional support. Residents set boundaries regarding the frequency and intensity of support. The provided support partly relieves residents' adult children from caregiving duties but does not substitute formal and informal care. Due to their access to contacts and support, few residents experience social loneliness. Co-housing communities can potentially also alleviate emotional loneliness, but currently, this happens to a limited degree.

We explored how stakeholders shaped the translation of health policy research into action. Our comparative case-study tracked a European research project that aimed to transfer an existing tobacco control return on investment tool. That project also aimed to increase its impact by engaging with stakeholders in further developing the tool. We conducted semi-structured interviews, using an actor-scenario mapping approach. Actor-scenarios can be seen as relational descriptions of a future world. We mapped the scenarios by asking stakeholders to describe who and what would play a role in the tool's utilisation. Our results show that stakeholders envisioned disparate futures for the tool. Some scenarios were specific, whereas most were generic projections of abstract potential users and responsibilities. We show how stakeholders mobilised elements of context, such as legislative support and agricultural practice, that would affect the tool's use. We conclude that stakeholders shape knowledge translation processes by continuously putting forth explicit or implicit scenarios about the future. Mapping actor-scenarios may help in aligning knowledge production with utilisation. Insights into potential roles and responsibilities could be fed back in research projects with the aim of increasing the likelihood that the study results may be used. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

However, trial populations may not reflect the real-world population. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes of cabazitaxel within and outside trials (standard of care, SOC). Patients and Methods: mCRPC patients treated with cabazitaxel directly after docetaxel therapy before 2017 were retrospectively identified and followed to 2018. Patients were grouped on the basis of treatment within a trial or SOC. Outcomes included OS and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. Results: From 3616 patients in the CAPRI registry, we identified 356 patients treated with cabazitaxel, with 173 patients treated in the second line. Trial patients had favorable prognostic factors: fewer symptoms, less visceral disease, lower lactate dehydrogenase, higher hemoglobin, more docetaxel cycles, and longer treatment-free interval since docetaxel therapy. PSA response (>= 50% decline) was 28 versus 12%, respectively (P = .209). Median OS was 13.6 versus 9.6 months for trial and SOC subgroups, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.73, P =.067). After correction for prognostic factors, there was no difference in survival (hazard ratio = 1.00, P = .999). Longer duration of androgen deprivation therapy treatment, lower lactate dehydrogenase, and lower PSA were associated with longer OS; visceral disease had a trend for shorter OS. Conclusion: Patients treated with cabazitaxel in trials were fitter and showed outcomes comparable to registration trials. Conversely, those treated in daily practice showed features of more aggressive disease and worse outcome. This underlines the importance of adequate estimation of trial eligibility and health status of mCRPC patients in daily practice to ensure optimal outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Iran ranks highly in tertiary education, productivity growth, knowledge impact and successful patent applications. In many countries, economic hardship has correlated with increased international research collaborations. Some have hypothesised that financial constraint drives scholars to seek outside collaborations for cost and risk sharing, and to access funding, materials and patient populations otherwise unavailable. This paper explores the history and importance of US political sanctions on the health of Iran's academic sector. Although Iran's international research collaborations increased during periods of increased sanctions, the Pearson correlation coefficient between gross domestic product and international research collaborations was not significant (r=0.183, p=0.417). This indicates that other factors are at least in part responsible. Additionally, we found Iran's quantitative (eg, publication number) and qualitative (eg, visibility indices) publishing metrics to be discordant (two-tailed Mann-Kendall trend; p<0.0002 for both). Reasons for this are multifactorial, including increased indexing of Iranian journals, willingness of lower visibility journals to handle manuscripts with Iranian authors, widespread linkage of career advancement to science visibility indices, and others. During periods of increased sanctions, Iranian scholars were increasingly denied opportunities to publish scientific findings, attend scientific meetings, access to essential medical and laboratory supplies and information resources. We conclude that academic boycotts violate researchers' freedom and curtail progress.

Semi-Structured Qualitative Interviews in Europe and the USA,"Background Patient preferences (PP), which are investigated in PP studies using qualitative or quantitative methods, are a growing area of interest to the following stakeholders involved in the medical product lifecycle: academics, health technology assessment bodies, payers, industry, patients, physicians, and regulators. However, the use of PP in decisions along the medical product lifecycle remains limited. As the adoption of PP heavily relies on these stakeholders, knowledge of their perceptions of PP is critical. Objective This study aimed to characterize stakeholders' attitudes, needs, and concerns with respect to PP in decision making along the medical product lifecycle. Methods Semi-structured interviews (n = 143) were conducted with academics (n = 24), health technology assessment/payer representatives (n = 24), industry representatives (n = 24), patients, caregivers and patient representatives (n = 24), physicians (n = 24), and regulators (n = 23) from seven European countries and the USA. Interviews were conducted between April and August 2017. The framework method was used to organize the data and identify themes and key findings in each interviewed stakeholder group. Results Interviewees reported being unfamiliar (43%), moderately familiar (42%), or very familiar (15%) with preference methods and studies. Interviewees across stakeholder groups generally supported the idea of using PP in the medical product lifecycle but expressed mixed opinions about the feasibility and impact of using PP in decision making. Interviewees from all stakeholder groups stressed the importance of increasing stakeholders' understanding of the concept of PP and preference methods and ensuring patients' understanding of the questions asked in PP studies. Key concerns and needs in each interviewed stakeholder group were as follows: (1) academics: investigating the validity, reliability, reproducibility, and generalizability of preference methods; (2) health technology assessment/payer representatives: developing quality criteria for evaluating PP studies and gaining insights into how to weigh them in reimbursement/payer decision making; (3) industry representatives: obtaining guidance on PP studies and recognition on the importance of PP from decision makers; (4) patients, caregivers, and patient representatives: providing an incentive and adequate information towards patients when participating in PP studies; (5) physicians: avoiding bias as a result of commercial agendas in PP studies and clarifying how to deal with subjective and emotional elements when measuring PP; and (6) regulators: avoiding the misuse of PP study results to overrule the traditional efficacy and safety criteria used for marketing authorization and obtaining robust PP study results. Conclusions Despite the interest all interviewed stakeholder groups reported in PP, the effective use of PP in decision making across the medical product lifecycle is currently hampered by a lack of standardization and consensus on how to both measure and use PP.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

This overview of systematic reviews explores the determinants of the cost-effectiveness of BCS and assesses the quality of secondary evidence. The search identified 30 systematic reviews that reported on the determinants of the cost-effectiveness of BCS, including the costs of breast cancer and BCS. While the quality of the reviews varied widely, only four out of 30 papers were considered to be of a high quality. We did not identify publication bias in the original evidence on the cost-effectiveness of mammography screening; however, we highlight a need for improved clarity in both reporting and data verification. The reviews consisted mainly of studies from high-income countries. Breast cancer costs varied widely among the studies. Factors leading to higher costs included: time (diagnosis and last months before death), later stage or metastases, recurrence of the disease, age below 64 years and type of follow-up (more intensive or more specialized). Overall, screening with mammography was considered cost-effective in the age range 50-69 years in Western European and Northern American countries but not for older or younger women. Its cost-effectiveness was questionable for low-income settings and Asia. Mammography screening was more cost-effective with biennial screening compared to annual screening and single reading using computer-aided detection vs double reading. No information on the cost-effectiveness of ultrasonography was found, and there is much uncertainty on the cost-effectiveness of CBE because of methodological limitations.",review,Oncology

We employed a representative survey experiment (n = 1,546) in which we test the effect of transparency in general (providing information about a decision or not) and the effect of specific types of transparency (process or rationale transparency). We do this for agencies supervising financial markets, education, and health care. We find that overall decision transparency significantly increases citizen trust in only two of the three agencies.

Most economies are struggling to deliver modern health care effectively. There is a need to support the transformation of the health care system into integrated care with organizational health literacy. Main body As an example for chronic disease care, MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel NetworK), a new project of the ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) initiative, and POLLAR (Impact of Air POLLution on Asthma and Rhinitis, EIT Health), in collaboration with professional and patient organizations in the field of allergy and airway diseases, are proposing real-life ICPs centred around the patient with rhinitis, and using mHealth to monitor environmental exposure. Three aspects of care pathways are being developed: (i) Patient participation, health literacy and self-care through technology-assisted ""patient activation"", (ii) Implementation of care pathways by pharmacists and (iii) Next-generation guidelines assessing the recommendations of GRADE guidelines in rhinitis and asthma using real-world evidence (RWE) obtained through mobile technology.

However, disinvestment programs face substantial social, political and cultural challenges: mistrust, struggles for clinical autonomy or stakeholders' reluctance to engage in what can be perceived as 'rationing'. Academic literature says little about effective strategies to address these challenges. This paper provides insights on this matter. We analyzed the epistemic work of a group of policymakers at the National Health Care Institute on what was initially a disinvestment initiative within the context of the Dutch basic benefits package: the 'Appropriate Care' program. The Institute developed a strategy using national administrative data to identify and tackle low-value care covered from public funds as well as potential underuse, and achieve savings through improved organization of efficiency and quality in health care delivery. How did the Institute deal with the socio-political sensitivities associated with disinvestment by means of their epistemic work? Method We conducted ethnographic research into the National Health Care Institute's epistemic practices. Research entailed document analysis, non-participant observation, in-depth conversations, and interviews with key-informants. Results The Institute dealt with the socio-political sensitivities associated with disinvestment by democratizing the epistemic practices to identify low-value care, by warranting data analysis by clinical experts, by creating an epistemic safe space for health care professionals who were the object of research into low-value care, and by de-emphasizing the economization measure. Ultimately, this epistemic work facilitated a collaborative construction of problems relating to low-value care practices and their solutions. Conclusions This case shows that - apart from the right data and adequate expertise - disinvestment requires clinical leadership and political will on the part of stakeholders. Our analysis of the Institute's Appropriate Care program shows how the epistemic effort to identify low-value care became a co-construction between policymakers, care providers, patients and insurers of problems of 'waste' in Dutch social health insurance. This collective epistemic work gave cognitive, moral and political standing to the idea of 'waste' in public health expenditure.",The Netherlands,Health Care Sciences & Services

However, research on the relationship between acculturation strategies (attachment to the Dutch and Turkish cultures) and broader self-management abilities among older Turkish immigrants in the Netherlands is lacking. This study aimed to investigate this relationship in this population. Methods Turkish immigrants aged > 65 years and residing in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (n = 2350), were identified using the municipal register. In total, 680 respondents completed the questionnaire (32% response rate). Results The average age of the respondents was 72.90 (standard deviation, 5.02; range, 66-95) years and 47.6% of respondents were women. The majority (80.3%) of respondents reported having low educational levels. Women, single individuals, less-educated respondents, and those with multimorbidity experienced lower levels of attachment to the Dutch culture and reported poorer self-management abilities. Slightly stronger relationships were found between self-management and attachment to the Dutch culture than attachment to the Turkish culture. Multimorbidity negatively affected the self-management abilities of older Turkish people living in the Netherlands. Conclusions The study findings indicate that especially attachment to the Dutch culture matters for the self-management abilities of older Turkish immigrants in the Netherlands. Given the high prevalence of multimorbidity in this population, investment in their self-management abilities is expected to be beneficial. Special attention is needed for women, single individuals, less-educated people, and those with multimorbidity. Interventions aiming to better integrate these groups into Dutch society are also expected to be beneficial for their self-management abilities.",Integration,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Drawing on the literature about the quantified self, this article shows that datafication evokes practices of gamification: the application of frames of play and rewards to the healthcare setting. We discern three (intermingling) practices of gamification: adapting, ignoring and changing. 'Adapting' refers to the incorporation of quantifying features in healthcare, while 'ignoring' sheds light on how practitioners seek to circumvent quantifying mechanisms. Change refers to how practitioners actually embrace quantifying mechanisms in order to extend (and improve) their work and to highlight their quantified professional self. We elucidate how datafication of healthcare 'opens up' and reconfigures established practices of organizing care and caring - not only for the patient but also to (re)craft the professional clinical identity.",professional identity,Medical Informatics

However, uncertainty in the estimate of severity can lead to problems when evaluating the outcomes of cost-effectiveness analyses.ObjectivesThis study standardizes the assessment of severity, integrates its uncertainty with the uncertainty in cost-effectiveness results and provides decision makers with a new estimate: the severity-adjusted probability of being cost effective.MethodsSeverity is expressed in proportional and absolute shortfall and estimated using life tables and country-specific EQ-5D values. We use the three severity-based cost-effectiveness thresholds (Euro20.000, Euro50.000 and Euro80.000, per QALY) adopted in The Netherlands. We exemplify procedures of integrating uncertainty with a stylized example of a hypothetical oncology treatment.ResultsApplying our methods, taking into account the uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness results and in the estimation of severity identifies the likelihood of an intervention being cost effective when there is uncertainty about the appropriate severity-based cost-effectiveness threshold.ConclusionsHigher willingness-to-pay thresholds for severe diseases are implemented in countries to reflect societal concerns for an equitable distribution of resources. However, the estimates of severity are uncertain, patient populations are heterogeneous, and this can be accounted for with the severity-adjusted probability of being cost effective proposed in this study. The application to the Netherlands suggests that not adopting the new method could result in incorrect decisions in the reimbursement of new health technologies.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

However, despite growing interest in the factors influencing the rural population's choice of facility, it is unclear how much weight should be placed on these factors, especially under different scenarios of disease severity. In the first study to elicit quantified trade-offs among influential factors in choosing health care facilities, we carried out a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in rural China. We used a Bayesian efficient design to construct 36 choice sets, and then divided them into three blocks. Each block formed one version of questionnaire that contained 12 choice questions. Each question was assigned a hypothetical perceived severity scenario of either minor or severe disease. 559 Rural residents completed the DCE through face-to-face interviews in December 2017-March 2018. We used mixed logit models to analyze the choice data. The factors regarding the availability and affordability of a facility, such as visit time, travel time, and out-of-pocket cost, were highly valued. When the facilities changed simultaneously from the worst to the best case, a huge increase (from 4.8% to 66.5%) in the predicted choice probability of choosing to visit a facility was observed under perceived minor disease scenario, whereas there was no significant change under perceived severe disease scenario. Improvements to drug availability, medical professional skill and equipment in rural primary care system can induce potential medical care seeking, and redirect patient flow from higher level hospitals to primary level. Especially, township health centers, which provide service to the residents in rural communities, have great potential to be the ideal facilities for first-contact care.",Rural health,Biomedical Social Sciences

A review of applications in different sectors,"Improving (feelings of) safety is an important goal of many health systems, especially in the context of recurrent threats of pandemics, and natural disasters. Measures to improve safety should be cost-effective, raising the issue of how to value safety. This is a complex task due to the intangible nature of safety. We aim to synthesize the current empirical literature on the evaluation of safety to gain insights into current methodological practices. After a thorough literature search in two databases for papers from the fields of life sciences, social sciences, physical sciences and health sciences that empirically measure the value of increasing safety, 33 papers were found and summarized. The focus of the research was to investigate the methodologies used. Attention was also paid to theoretical papers and the methodological issues they present, and the relationship between safety and three categories of covariate results: individual characteristics, individual relationship with risk, and study design. The field of research in which the most papers were found was environmental economics, followed by transportation and health. There appeared to be two main methods for valuating safety: Contingent Valuation and Discrete Choice Experiments, within which there were also differences-for example the use of open or dichotomous choice questions. Overall this paper finds that there still appears to be a long way ahead before consensus can be attained about a standardised methodology for valuating safety. Safety valuation research would benefit from learning from previous experience and the development of more standardised methods.",Safety,Health Care Sciences & Services

The multimodal intervention included (1) adding an emergency nurse practitioner (ENP) and (2) five medical specialists during peak hours to the 24/7 available emergency physicians (EPs), (3) a Lean programme to improve radiology turnaround times, and (4) extending the admission offices' openings hours.Crowding is measured with the modified National ED OverCrowding Score (mNEDOCS). Furthermore, radiology turnaround times, patients' length of stay (LOS), proportion of patients leaving without being seen (LWBS) by a medical provider, and unscheduled representations are assessed.ResultsThe number of ED visits were grossly similar in the two periods during peak hours (15,558 ED visits in the pre-intervention period and 15,550 in the intervention period) and overall (31,891 ED visits in the pre-intervention period vs. 32,121 in the intervention period). During peak hours, ED crowding fell from 18.6% (pre-intervention period) to 3.5% (intervention period), radiology turnaround times decreased from an average of 91min (interquartile range 45-256min) to 50min (IQR 30-106min., p<0.001) and LOS reduced with 13min per patient from 167 to 154min (p<0.001). For surgery, neurology and cardiology patients, LOS reduced significantly (with 17min, 25min, and 8min. respectively), while not changing for internal medicine patients. Overall, crowding, radiology turnaround times and LOS also decreased. Less patients LWBS in the intervention period (270 patients vs. 348 patients, p<0.001) and less patients represented unscheduled within 1week after the initial ED visit: 864 (2.7%) in the pre-intervention period vs. 645 (2.0%) patients in the intervention period, p<0.001.ConclusionsIn this hospital, a multimodal intervention successfully reduces crowding, radiology turnaround times, patients' LOS, number of patients LWBS and the number of unscheduled return visits, suggesting improved ED processes.

In the context of ageing populations and changing healthcare systems, live-in care enables ageing in place without overburdening family caregivers. However, research has shown that live-in care often puts migrant care workers and their recipients in precarious positions. While the outcome of precarious work has gained attention, it is not self-evident. Based on interviews with migrant care workers in the Netherlands, as well as formal and informal caregivers, and the staff of intermediary organisations, this study shows that besides client conditions, the interactions of actors in the care network shape the circumstances and experience of migrant live-in care work. The findings suggest that managing the care networks to which migrant care workers belong makes it possible to mitigate the associated precariousness.",precariousness,Social Work

Herein, we present guidelines to provide a structured approach to comparisons of multiple models of interventions against infectious diseases. The primary target audience for these guidelines are researchers carrying out model comparison studies and policy-makers using model comparison studies to inform policy decisions. Methods The consensus process used for the development of the guidelines included a systematic review of existing model comparison studies on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination, a 2-day meeting and guideline development workshop during which mathematical modellers from different disease areas critically discussed and debated the guideline content and wording, and several rounds of comments on sequential versions of the guidelines by all authors. Results The guidelines provide principles for multi-model comparisons, with specific practice statements on what modellers should do for six domains. The guidelines provide explanation and elaboration of the principles and practice statements as well as some examples to illustrate these. The principles are (1) the policy and research question - the model comparison should address a relevant, clearly defined policy question; (2) model identification and selection - the identification and selection of models for inclusion in the model comparison should be transparent and minimise selection bias; (3) harmonisation - standardisation of input data and outputs should be determined by the research question and value of the effort needed for this step; (4) exploring variability - between- and within-model variability and uncertainty should be explored; (5) presenting and pooling results - results should be presented in an appropriate way to support decision-making; and (6) interpretation - results should be interpreted to inform the policy question. Conclusion These guidelines should help researchers plan, conduct and report model comparisons of infectious diseases and related interventions in a systematic and structured manner for the purpose of supporting health policy decisions. Adherence to these guidelines will contribute to greater consistency and objectivity in the approach and methods used in multi-model comparisons, and as such improve the quality of modelled evidence for policy.",Harmonisation,General & Internal Medicine

The availability of those technologies intensifies the discussion regarding the affordability of these technologies at different decision-making levels. On the meso level, both hospitals and clinicians are facing budget constraints resulting in a tension to balance between different patients' interests. As such, it is crucial to make optimal use of the available resources. Different strategies are in place to deal with this problem, but decisions on a macro level on what to fund or not can limit the role and freedom of clinicians in their decisions on a micro level. At the same time, without central guidance regarding such decisions, micro level decisions may lead to inequities and undesirable treatment variation between clinicians and hospitals. The challenge is to find instruments that can balance both levels of decision making. Discussion Clinicians are becoming increasingly aware that their decisions to spend more resources (like time and budget) on 1 particular patient group reduce the resources available to other patients. Involving clinicians in thinking about the optimal use of limited resources, also in an attempt to bridge the world of economic reasoning and clinical practice, is crucial therefore. We argue that clinical guidelines may prove a clear vehicle for this by including both clinical and economic evidence to support the recommendations made. The development of such guidelines requires cooperation of clinicians, and health economists are cooperating with each other. Conclusion The development of clinical guidelines which combine economic and clinical evidence should be stimulated, to balance central guidance and uniformity while maintaining necessary decentralized freedom. This is an opportunity to combine the reality of budgets and opportunity costs with clinical practice. Missing this opportunity risks either variation and inequity or central and necessarily crude measures.",health care,General & Internal Medicine

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's submission, the ERG review, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The clinical evidence was derived from two phase III, company-sponsored, randomised, open-label studies. Most evidence on obinutuzumab was based on the GALLIUM trial that compared obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy as induction followed by obinutuzumab maintenance monotherapy with rituximab in combination with chemotherapy as induction followed by rituximab maintenance monotherapy in previously untreated patients with FL (grades 1-3a). Long-term clinical evidence was based on the PRIMA trial, studying the benefit of two years of rituximab maintenance after first-line treatment in patients with FL. The cost-effectiveness evidence submitted by the company relied on a partitioned survival cost-utility model, implemented in Microsoft (R) Excel. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) presented in the company submission was <20,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Although the ERG concluded that the economic model met the NICE reference case to a reasonable extent, some errors were identified and several assumptions made by the company were challenged. A new base-case scenario produced by the ERG suggested an ICER that was higher than the company base case, but still below 30,000 pound per QALY gained. However, some ERG scenario analyses were close to or even above the threshold. This was the case in particular for assuming a treatment effect that did not extend beyond trial follow-up. These results led to an initial negative recommendation by the appraisal committee. Subsequently, the company submitted a revised base case focusing on patients at intermediate or high risk of premature mortality. Simultaneously, a further price discount for obinutuzumab was granted. In addition to the company's revised base case, the ERG suggested a restriction of the treatment effect to 5 years and implemented biosimilar uptake and cheaper prices for rituximab. All of these adjustments did not exceed 30,000 pound per QALY gained and therefore the use of obinutuzumab for patients with advanced FL and a Follicular Lymphoma International Predictive Index (FLIPI) score of two or more could be recommended.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Evidence from the rural health project in China,"In 2008, the Rural Health Project (Health XI) was initiated in 40 Chinese counties to pilot interventions aimed at improving local health systems. Performance targets were pre-specified (results-based), and project counties were allowed to tailor their interventions (bottom-up) in recognition of the substantial regional variations. Using household data from the China National Health Services Survey in a difference-in-differences strategy combined with matching, we find that project counties have improved outcomes (both incentivized and not-directly-incentivized) in all three domains examined-medical care, public health services, and self-rated health-by 2013. In particular, the decrease in outpatient intravenous drip use and financial strain and the increase in all four components of public health services provision are robust to a variety of tests and alternative matching strategies. Results for not-directly-incentivized indicators suggest that results-based payment did not lead to multitasking problems but rather to positive spillovers. On the other hand, little improvement in inpatient-related indicators suggests that the Health XI interventions did not successfully redress the perverse incentives driving the bulk of providers' income. In general, however, our results indicate that interventions adopted in the results-based bottom-up approach generated substantial benefits given the investment.",multitasking,Health Care Sciences & Services

Given these assumptions, Rabin's paradox (RP) involves preferences over mixed gambles yielding moderate outcomes, where turning down such gambles imply absurd levels of risk aversion. Although RP is considered a classic critique of expected utility, no paper has as of yet fully tested its preferences within individuals. In an experiment we report a direct test of RP in the health domain, which was previously only considered in the economic literature, showing it may have pervasive implications here too. Our paper supports the shift towards alternative, empirically valid models, such as prospect theory, also in the health domain. These alternative models are able to accommodate Rabin's paradox by allowing reference-dependence and loss aversion.",risk aversion,Health Care Sciences & Services

Using Demographic and Health Survey data, we document significant reductions in stunting in seven SSA countries in the period 2005-2014. For each country, we distinguish potential determinants that move in a direction consistent with having contributed to the reduction in stunting from those that do not. We then decompose the change in stunting and in proximal determinants into a part that can be explained by changes in distal determinants and a residual part that captures the impact of unmeasured factors, such as vertical nutrition programs. We show that increases in coverage of child immunization, deworming medication and maternal iron supplementation often coincide with a fall in stunting. The magnitudes and directions of changes in two other proximal determinants age-appropriate feeding and diarrhea prevalence - suggest that these have not been strong contributors to the fall in stunting. Utilization of maternity care emerges from the decomposition analysis as the most important distal determinant associated with reduced stunting, and also with increased coverage of iron supplementation, and, to a lesser extent, with child immunization and deworming medication. This circumstantial evidence is strong enough to warrant more detailed investigation of the extent to which maternity care is an effective channel through which to target further attacks on the blight of undernourished children.",Sub-Saharan Africa,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

With this concept, we advance discussions on places as bounded and open, pointing to the work and consequences of 'binding' place and opening up the concept for further application to various sociological concerns, particularly in healthcare.",place-by-proxy,Sociology

Little research has been done on care providers' trust in older persons. This study aims to explore the level of trust that informal carers and home care nurses have in older persons, the extent of alignment in triads and the relationship between trust in older persons and self-management. We conducted a cross-sectional survey study in the Netherlands, sampling 133 older persons, 64 informal carers and 72 nurses, which resulted in 39 triads. Alignment level was analysed through Intraclass Correlation Coefficient 1 scores and absolute and mean difference scores. Correlation analysis and one-way analysis of variance measured the relationship between trust and self-management. The results show that triads contain both alignment and misalignment. Misalignment occurs mostly when informal carers and nurses have little trust in the older person while this person views their own behaviour towards their caregivers positively. Care providers' trust levels relate significantly to their perception of the person's ability to self-manage, but not to the person's self-rated ability. This could be explained by care providers not communicating their intrinsic trust in the older person to them. Trust building could be enhanced by organising discussions of mutual expectations of trust and both formal and informal care providers could benefit from compassionate assessment training, to learn how to openly express their trust in the older person.",trust,Social Work

Methods This was a multicentre, nonrandomised, controlled intervention study with pre-post comparison (2013 vs June 2014 to May 2015) in 25 general practices in the Netherlands, comparing NDP-led care (intervention) with 2 current pharmaceutical care models (usual care and usual care plus). In the intervention group, 10 specially trained NDPs were employed in general practices to take integral responsibility for the pharmaceutical care. They provided a broad range of medication therapy management services both on patient level (e.g. clinical medication review) and practice level (e.g. quality improvement projects). In the control groups, pharmaceutical care was provided as usual by general practitioners and community pharmacists, or as usual plus, when pharmacists were additionally trained in performing medication reviews. Results Overall, 822 medication-related hospitalisations were identified among 11 281 high-risk patients during the intervention period. After adjustment for clustering and potential confounders, the rate ratio of medication-related hospitalisations in the intervention group compared to usual care was 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.57-0.82) and 1.05 (95% confidence interval: 0.73-1.52) compared to usual care plus. No differences in drug burden index or costs were found. Conclusions In general practices with an integrated NDP, the rate of medication-related hospitalisations is lower compared to usual care. No differences with usual care plus were found.",primary care,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Eight dimensions of PCC have been identified: taking patients' preferences into account; access to care; emotional support; physical comfort; information and education; involvement of family and friends; coordination of care; and continuity and secure transition. Objective of this study is to validate an instrument to assess these eight PCC dimensions among informal caregivers of PWIDs in residential settings (institutional settings as well as group homes in the community). The original 24-item instrument was developed and validated among professionals providing care to PWIDs.MethodsThis study was conducted in a disability care centre in the Netherlands. All informal caregivers of PWIDs living in institutional settings or group homes in the community in need of 24-h care were invited to participate (n=941). The response rate was 31% (n=289). We tested the instrument using structural equation modelling, and examined its validity and reliability.ResultsConfirmatory factor analyses revealed good indices of fit and overall internal consistency, as represented by Cronbach's alpha values. All eight dimensions of PCC were related positively to satisfaction with care (all p <= 0.001). As expected, informal caregivers were less critical of PCC and its underlying dimensions, except for information and education, than were professionals working in the same disability care centre.ConclusionsThe psychometric properties of the 24-item PCC instrument for informal caregivers (PCC-IC) were satisfactory, indicating that the PCC-IC is valid and reliable for the assessment of the eight dimensions of PCC among informal caregivers of PWIDs in residential settings.",PCC-IC,Health Care Sciences & Services

Background Developments in health care ask for well-trained nurse leaders. Advanced Practice Nurses and Clinical Nurse Leaders are ideally positioned to lead healthcare reform in nursing. Nurses should be adequately equipped for this role based on internationally defined leadership competencies. Therefore, identifying leadership competencies and related attributes internationally is needed. Design Integrative review. Methods Embase, Medline and CINAHL databases were searched (January 2005-December 2018). Also, websites of international professional nursing organizations were searched for frameworks on leadership competencies. Study and framework selection, identification of competencies, quality appraisal of included studies and analysis of data were independently conducted by two researchers. Results Fifteen studies and seven competency frameworks were included. Synthesis of 150 identified competencies led to a set of 30 core competencies in the clinical, professional, health systems. and health policy leadership domains. Most competencies fitted in one single domain the health policy domain contained the least competencies. Conclusions This synthesis of 30 core competencies within four leadership domains can be used for further development of evidence-based curricula on leadership. Next steps include further refining of competencies, addressing gaps, and the linking of knowledge, skills, and attributes. Impact These findings contribute to leadership development for Advanced Practice Nurses and Clinical Nurse Leaders while aiming at improved health service delivery and guiding of health policies and reforms.",literature review,Nursing

In order to improve the population's diet, the World Health Organization has called for the taxation of foods that are high in SFA. We aimed to assess the potential health gains of a European fat tax by applying the SFA intake reduction that has been observed under the Danish fat tax to six other European countries. For each country, we created a fat tax scenario with a decreased SFA intake and a corresponding increase in PUFA. We compared this fat tax scenario to a reference scenario with no change in SFA intake, and to a guideline scenario with a population-wide SFA intake in line with dietary recommendations. We used DYNAMO-HIA to dynamically project the policy-attributable IHD cases of these three scenarios 10 years into the future. A fat tax would reduce prevalent IHD cases by a minimum of 500 and 300 among males and females in Denmark, respectively, up to a maximum of 5,600 and 4,000 among males and females in the UK. Thereby, the prevented IHD cases under a fat tax scenario would correspond to between 11.0% (in females in the Netherlands) and 29.5% (in females in Italy) of the prevented IHD cases under a guideline scenario, which represents the maximum preventable disease burden. Henceforth, our quantification of beneficial health impacts makes the case for the policy debate on fat taxes.",,Science & Technology - Other Topics

The economic evaluation was performed from a healthcare perspective with a time horizon of 12months. The target population consisted of community-dwelling frail older persons aged >= 75years in the FFF intervention group (11 general practitioner (GP) practices) and in the control group receiving usual care (4 GP practices). The effectiveness measures for the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were subjective well-being (Social Production Function Instrument for the Level of well-being short; SPF-ILs) and QALYs (EuroQol; EQ-5D-3L), respectively. Costs were assessed using resource use questionnaires. Differences in mean effectiveness between groups were assessed using univariate, multilevel and propensity score matched analyses, with and without imputation of missing values. Differences in costs were assessed using Mann-Whitney U-tests and independent samples t-tests. Bootstrapping was performed, and predicted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were depicted on cost-effectiveness planes.ResultsThe various analyses showed slightly different results with respect to differences in estimated costs and effects. Multilevel analyses showed a small but significant difference between the groups for well-being, in favor of the control group. No significant differences between groups in terms of QALYs were found. Imputed data showed that mean total costs were significantly higher in the intervention group at follow-up.ConclusionProactive, integrated care for community-dwelling frail older persons as provided in the FFF program is most likely not a cost-effective initiative, compared with usual primary care in the Netherlands, in terms of well-being and QALYs over a 12-month period.",Quasi-experimental design,Health Care Sciences & Services

Dutch private insurers caught between competing logics,"For almost a century, the Netherlands was marked by a large market for voluntary private health insurance alongside state-regulated social health insurance. Throughout this period, private health insurers tried to safeguard their position within an expanding welfare state. From an institutional logics perspective, we analyze how private health insurers tried to reconcile the tension between a competitive insurance market pressuring for selective underwriting and actuarially fair premiums (the insurance logic), and an upcoming welfare state pressuring for universal access and socially fair premiums (the welfare state logic). Based on primary sources and the extant historiography, we distinguish six periods in which the balance between both logics changed significantly. We identify various strategies employed by private insurers to reconcile the competing logics. Some of these were temporarily successful, but required measures that were incompatible with the idea of free entrepreneurship and consumer choice. We conclude that universal access can only be achieved in a competitive individual private health insurance market if this market is effectively regulated and mandatory cross-subsidies are effectively enforced. The Dutch case demonstrates that achieving universal access in a competitive private health insurance market is institutionally complex and requires broad political and societal support.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

Nonparametric correction of time trade-off and standard gamble weights based on prospect theory,"Common health state valuation methodologies, such as standard gamble (SG) and time trade-off (TTO), typically produce different weights for identical health states. We attempt to alleviate these differences by correcting the confounding influences modeled in prospect theory: loss aversion and probability weighting. Furthermore, we correct for nonlinear utility of life duration. In contrast to earlier attempts at correcting TTO and SG weights, we measure and correct all these tenets simultaneously, using newly developed nonparametric methodology. These corrections were applied to three less-than-perfect health states, measured with TTO and SG. We found considerable loss aversion and probability weighting for both gains and losses in life years, and we observe concave utility for gains and convex utility for losses in life years. After correction, the initially significant differences in weights between TTO and SG disappeared for all health states. Our findings suggest new opportunities to account for bias in health state valuations but also the need for further validation of resulting weights.",time trade-off,Health Care Sciences & Services

Since morbid obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the current study investigated whether the association between sex and cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes can be demonstrated in subjects suffering from morbid obesity. Materials and methods Two hundred subjects enrolled in a study on cardiovascular risk factors in morbid obesity underwent extensive laboratory screening, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements. Gender differences were analysed using univariate and multivariable linear regression models. In addition, the effect of menopause on cIMT and PWV was analysed. Results of these models were reported as B coefficients with 95% confidence intervals. Results The group consisted of 52 men and 148 women, with a mean age of 41 (+/- 11.8) years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 42.7 (+/- 5.2) kg/m(2). Both, cIMT and PWV were significantly higher in men than in women, although the difference in cIMT disappeared after adjustment for covariables such as waist circumference, age, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and mean arterial pressure. PWV was associated with sex after adjustments for covariables in morbidly obese patients. Postmenopausal women had significantly increased cIMT and PWV when compared with premenopausal women. Conclusion Sex differences in PWV persist in subjects suffering from morbid obesity. However, no difference was found in cIMT between morbidly obese men and women after adjustment for classic cardiovascular risk factors.

Up to 50% of UM patients will develop metastases. We present data of 175 metastatic UM patients diagnosed in the Netherlands between July 2012 and March 2018. In our cohort, elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (LDH) is an important factor associated with poorer survival (Hazard Ratio (HR) 9.0, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 5.63-14.35), and the presence of liver metastases is negatively associated with survival (HR 2.09, 95%CI 1.07-4.08).

Methods: PsyMod was built in parallel with the development of a new standard of care for treatment of early psychosis in the Netherlands. PsyMod is a state-transition cohort simulation model and considers six health states, namely ultra-high risk of psychosis (UHR), FEP, post-FEP, no-UHR, recovery/remission, and death.

Results: PsyMod was used to extrapolate budget impact and cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for preventing FEP for individuals at UHR of psychosis (CBTuhr) compared to care as usual. CBTuhr resulted in a per-patient increase of 0.06 QALYs and a per patient cost reduction of euro654 (dominant ICER) with a reduction in 5-year healthcare costs of euro1,002,166.

Furthermore, the impact of an economic recession on this relationship is unclear. We investigated the associations of single transitions and persistence of unemployment with health. We subsequently examined whether these associations are affected by the latest recession, which began in 2008.MethodsIn total, 57,911 participants from the Dutch Health Interview Survey who belonged to the labour force between 2004 and 2014 were included. Based on longitudinal tax registration data, single employment transitions between time point 1 (t1) and time point 2 (t2) and persistent unemployment (i.e. number of years individuals were unemployed) between t1 and time point 5 (t5) were defined. General and mental health, smoking and obesity were assessed at respectively time point 3 (t3) and time point 6 (t6). Logistic regression models were performed and interactions with recession indicators (year, annual gross domestic product estimates and regional unemployment rates) were tested.ResultsCompared with individuals who stayed employed at t1 and t2, the likelihood of poor mental health at the subsequent year was significantly higher in those who became unemployed at t2. Persistent unemployment was associated with poor mental health, especially for those who were persistently unemployed for 5years. Similar patterns, although less pronounced for smoking, were found for general health and obesity. Indicators of the economic recession did not modify these associations.ConclusionsSingle transitions into unemployment and persistent unemployment are associated with poor mental and general health, obesity, and to a lesser extend smoking. Our study suggests that re-employment might be an important strategy to improve health of unemployed individuals. The relatively extensive Dutch social security system may explain that the economic recession did not modify these associations.",Longitudinal study,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Research has revealed numerous factors that are regarded as necessary for 'medical leaders' to master, however we lack insights into their relative importance. This study investigates the views of healthcare professionals and managers on what they consider the most important factors for medical leadership. Physicians (n = 11), nurses (n = 10), laboratory technicians (n = 4) and managers (n = 14) were interviewed using Q methodology. Participants ranked 34 statements on factors elicited from the scientific literature, including personal features, context-specific features, activities and roles. By-person factor analysis revealed three distinct views of medical leadership. The first view represents a strategic leader who prioritizes the interests of the hospital by participating in hospital strategy and decision making. The second view describes a social leader with strong collaboration and communication skills. The third view reflects an accepted leader among peers that is guided by a clear job description. Despite these differences, all respondents agreed upon the importance of personal skills in collaboration and communication, and having integrity and a clear vision. We find no differences in views related to particular healthcare professionals, managers, or departments as all views were defined by a mixture of departments and participants. The findings contribute to increased calls from both practice and literature to increase conceptual clarity by eliciting the relative importance of medical leadership-related factors. Hospitals that wish to increase the engagement of physicians in improving clinical and financial performances through medical leadership should focus on selecting and developing leaders who are strong strategists, socially skilled and accepted by clinical peers.",,Science & Technology - Other Topics

To this end, the manuscript articulates four different protocols aiming at assessing large-scale implementation of integrated care, which are being developed within the umbrella of the regional project Nextcare (2016-2019), undertaken to foster innovation in technologically-supported services for chronic multimorbid patients in Catalonia (ES) (7.5M inhabitants).Whereas one of the assessment protocols is designed to evaluate population-based deployment of care coordination at regional level during the period 2011-2017, the other three are service-based protocols addressing: i) Home hospitalization; ii) Prehabilitation for major surgery; and, iii) Community-based interventions for frail elderly chronic patients. All three services have demonstrated efficacy and potential for health value generation. They reflect different implementation maturity levels. While full coverage of the entire urban health district of Barcelona-Esquerra (520k inhabitants) is the main aim of home hospitalization, demonstration of sustainability at Hospital Clinic of Barcelona constitutes the core goal of the prehabilitation service. Likewise, full coverage of integrated care services addressed to frail chronic patients is aimed at the city of Badalona (216k inhabitants).MethodsThe population-based analysis, as well as the three service-based protocols, follow observational and experimental study designs using a non-randomized intervention group (integrated care) compared with a control group (usual care) with a propensity score matching method. Evaluation of cost-effectiveness of the interventions using a Quadruple aim approach is a central outcome in all protocols. Moreover, multi-criteria decision analysis is explored as an innovative method for health delivery assessment. The following additional dimensions will also be addressed: i) Determinants of sustainability and scalability of the services; ii) Assessment of the technological support; iii) Enhanced health risk assessment; and, iv) Factors modulating service transferability.DiscussionThe current study offers a unique opportunity to undertake a comprehensive assessment of integrated care fostering deployment of services at regional level. The study outcomes will contribute refining service workflows, improving health risk assessment and generating recommendations for service selection.Trials registrationNCT03130283 (date released 04/06/2018), NCT03768050 (date released 12/05/2018), NCT03767387 (date released 12/05/2018).",Multi-criteria decision analysis,Health Care Sciences & Services

However, to date, there is a paucity of measures that could guide the selection of the initial treatment, in particular to indicate which patients with MDD are in need of highly specialized care. Recognizing this gap, this paper reports on the development and psychometric evaluation of the Decision Tool Unipolar Depression (DTUD), aimed to facilitate the early identification of patients with MDD in need of highly specialized care.MethodsThe DTUD was developed using a mixed-methods approach, consisting of a systematic review and a concept mapping study. To evaluate the psychometric features of the DTUD, a cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted. A total of 243 patients with MDD were evaluated with the DTUD. Feasibility was operationalized as the time required to complete the DTUD and the content clarity of the DTUD. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated using Krippendorf's alpha. The Maudsley Staging Method (MSM) and the Dutch Measure for quantification of Treatment Resistance in Depression (DM-TRD) were administered to assess the convergent validity. A receiver operator characteristic curve was generated to evaluate the criterion validity and establish the optimal cut-off value.ResultsThe mean administration time was 4.49min (SD=2.71), and the content of the total DTUD was judged as clear in 94.7% of the evaluations. Inter-rater reliability values ranged from 0.69 to 0.91. Higher scores on the DTUD were associated with higher scores on the MSM (r(s)=0.47) and DM-TRD (r(s)=0.53). Based on the maximum Youden index (0.494), maximum discrimination was reached at a cut-off score of 5 (sensitivity 67%, specificity 83%).ConclusionThe DTUD demonstrated to be a tool with solid psychometric properties and, therefore, is a promising measure for the early identification of patients with MDD in need of highly specialized care. Use of the DTUD has the potential to facilitate the selection and initiation of the optimal initial treatment in patients with MDD, which in turn may improve the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies.",Tertiary healthcare,Psychiatry

We provide empirical evidence for this proposal from a quality perspective, using over 250,000 patient discharge records from 60 German hospitals across 39 high-mortality disease segments, and focusing on in-hospital mortality as outcome. Disentangling the effects of high, absolute, and relative hospital volumes in a disease group, our analysis suggests that routine and complex patients would benefit from a hospital organization with a multi-specialty hub for emergency and non-routine elective services at its core, complemented by organizationally separate disease-focused hospitals-within-hospitals for routine services. We also provide evidence that the hub hospital can further improve service quality for complex patients by adopting a disease-based rather than medical specialty-based departmental routing strategy for newly arriving patients. A counterfactual analysis, based on a simultaneous equations probit model that simultaneously controls for endogeneity of volume, focus, and routing strategy, suggests that the proposed reorganization could have reduced mortality in the sample by 13.43% (95% CI [6.87%; 18.95%]) for routine patients and by 11.67% (95% CI [6.13%; 16.86%]) for the most complex patients.",mortality,Operations Research & Management Science

Therefore, it is essential to identify patient perspectives regarding the value of patient preference information (PPI).ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to explore how patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) value the use of PPI in regulatory decision making regarding medical products.MethodsRegulators and patients with RA were interviewed to gather initial insights into opinions on the use of PPI in regulatory decisions regarding medical products. The interviews were used to draft and validate the interview guide for focus groups with patients with RA. Participants were purposively sampled in collaboration with the Swedish Rheumatism Association in Stockholm and Uppsala. Each focus group consisted of three to six patients (18 in total). All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using content analysis.ResultsAccording to the participants, PPI could lead to regulators considering patients' needs, lifestyles and well-being when making decisions. PPI was important in all stages of the medical product lifecycle. Participants reported that, when participating in a preference study, it is important to be well-informed about the use of the study and the development, components, administration, and risks related to the medical products.ConclusionsPatients thought PPI could be valuable to consider in regulatory decisions. It is essential for patients to be well-informed when asked for their preferences.

Empirical evidence whether differences in cost-sharing rates across providers affects patient choice behavior is, especially from Europe, limited. This paper examines the effect of a differential deductible to steer patient provider choice in a Dutch regional market for varicose veins treatment. Using individual patients' choice data and information about their out-of-pocket payments covering the year of the experiment and 1 year before, we estimate a conditional logit model that explicitly controls for pre-existing patient preferences. Our results suggest that in this natural experiment designating preferred providers and waiving the deductible for enrollees using these providers significantly influenced patient choice. The average cross-price elasticity of demand is found to be 0.02, indicating that patient responsiveness to the cost-sharing differential itself was low. Unlike fixed cost-sharing differences, the deductible exemption was conditional on the patient's other medical expenses occurring in the policy year. The differential deductible did, therefore, not result in a financial benefit for patients with annual costs exceeding their total deductible.",Patient choice,Health Care Sciences & Services

Despite growing evidence of the efficacy of (non)pharmacological interventions to reduce these symptoms, NPS remain underrecognized and undertreated in memory clinics. The BEhavioural symptoms in Alzheimer's disease Towards early Identification and Treatment (BEAT-IT) study is developed to (1) investigate the neurobiological etiology of NPS in AD and (2) study the effectiveness of the Describe, Investigate, Create, Evaluate (DICE) approach to structure and standardize the current care of NPS in AD. By means of the DICE method, we aim to improve the quality of life of AD patients with NPS and their caregivers who visit the memory clinic. This paper describes the protocol for the intervention study that incorporates the latter aim.MethodsWe aim to enroll a total of 150 community-dwelling patients with MCI or AD and their caregivers in two waves. First, we will recruit a control group who will receive care as usual. Next, the second wave of participants will undergo the DICE method. This approach consists of the following steps: (1) describe the context in which NPS occur, (2) investigate the possible causes, (3) create and implement a treatment plan, and (4) evaluate whether these interventions are effective. Primary outcomes are the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Secondary outcomes include NPS change, caregiver burden, caregivers' confidence managing NPS, psychotropic medication use, the experiences of patients and caregivers who underwent the DICE method, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.ConclusionsThis paper describes the protocol of an intervention study that is part of the BEAT-IT study and aims to improve current recognition and treatment of NPS in AD by structuring and standardizing the detection and treatment of NPS in AD using the DICE approach.Trial registrationThe trial was registered on the Netherlands Trial Registry (NTR7459); registered 6 September 2018.",Quality of life,Neurosciences & Neurology

In addition, it explored the Dutch general population's opinions regarding the inclusion of infertility treatments in the Dutch health insurers' basic benefit package. An online questionnaire was designed to determine the health-related quality of life values of six fertility-impaired health states. The study population consisted of a representative sample of the Dutch adult population. Respondents were asked to evaluate the health states through direct health valuation methods, i.e. the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Time Trade-Off (TTO) method. In addition, respondents were asked about their opinions regarding reimbursement of fertility-related treatments.ResultsThe respondents' (n=767) VAS scores ranged from 0.640 to 0.796.

For contextualization, we apply our framework to rabies surveillance. Our data reveal that respondents underestimate their chances of getting a good outcome in uncertain situations, and they overestimate their chances of bad outcomes. Moreover, losses loom larger than gains of the same absolute magnitude to the respondents. We find no differences between the estimated parameters for timeliness and false positive rates. Our results indicate that the biases described are present among public health professionals, and highlight the need to adjust for them when eliciting their preferences for surveillance systems.",,Tropical Medicine

To evaluate the impact of adding a respiratory dimension (a bolt-on dimension) to the EQ-5D-5L health state valuations. Methods. Based on extensive regression and principal component analyses, 2 respiratory bolt-on candidates were formulated: R1, limitations in physical activities due to shortness of breath, and R2, breathing problems. Valuation interviews for the selected bolt-ons were performed with a representative sample from the Dutch general public using the standardized interview protocol and software of the EuroQol group. Hybrid models based on the combined time-tradeoff (TTO) and discrete choice experiment (DCE) data were estimated to assess whether the 5 levels of the respiratory bolt-on led to significant changes in utility values. Results. For each bolt-on candidate, slightly more than 200 valuation interviews were conducted. Mean TTO values and DCE choice probabilities for health states with a level 4 or 5 for the respiratory dimension were significantly lower compared with the same health states in the Dutch EQ-5D-5L valuation study without the respiratory dimension. Results of hybrid models showed that for the bolt-on ""limitations in physical activities,"" the utility decrements were significant for level 3 (-0.055), level 4 (-0.087), and level 5 (-0.135). For ""breathing problems,"" the utility decrements for the same levels were greater (-0.086, -0.219, and -0.327, respectively). Conclusions. The addition of each of the 2 respiratory bolt-ons to the EQ-5D-5L had a significant effect on the valuation of health states with severe levels for the bolt-on.

The importance of each attribute can be quantified by analyzing respondents' choices. Estimates are valid only if alternatives are defined comprehensively, but choice tasks can become too difficult for respondents if too many attributes are included. Several solutions for this dilemma have been proposed, but these have practical or theoretical drawbacks and cannot be applied in all settings. The objective of the current article is to demonstrate an alternative solution, the fold-in, fold-out approach (FiFo). We use a motivating example, the ABC Index for burden of disease in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods Under FiFo, all attributes are part of all choice sets, but they are grouped into domains. These are either folded in (all attributes have the same level) or folded out (levels may differ). FiFo was applied to the valuation of the ABC Index, which included 15 attributes. The data were analyzed in Bayesian mixed logit regression, with additional parameters to account for increased complexity in folded-out questionnaires and potential differences in weight due to the folding status of domains. As a comparison, a model without the additional parameters was estimated. Results Folding out domains led to increased choice complexity for respondents. It also gave domains more weight than when it was folded in. The more complex regression model had a better fit to the data than the simpler model. Not accounting for choice complexity in the models resulted in a substantially different ABC Index. Conclusion Using a combination of folded-in and folded-out attributes is a feasible approach for conducting DCEs with many attributes.",Burden of disease,Medical Informatics

To support evidence-based decision making, we performed a network meta-analysis for NTE MM patients that synthesizes direct and indirect evidence and enables a comparison of all treatments. Relevant randomized clinical trials were identified by a systematic literature review in EMBASE (R), MEDLINE (R), MEDLINE (R)-in-Process and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for January 1999 to March 2016. Efficacy outcomes [i.e. the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for progression-free survival] were extracted and synthesized in a random effects network-meta analysis. In total, 24 studies were identified including 21 treatments. According to the network-meta analysis, the HR for progression-free survival was favorable for all NTE MM treatments compared to dexamethasone (HR: 0.19-0.90). Daratumumab-bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone and bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide with bortezomib-thalidomide maintenance were identified as the most effective treatments (HR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.08-0.45 and HR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.10-0.51, respectively). HR and 95% CI for currently recommended treatments, bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone, bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone, and lenalidomide-dexamethasone compared to dexamethasone, were 0.31 (0.16-0.59), 0.39 (0.20-0.75), and 0.44 (0.29-0.65), respectively. In addition to identifying the most effective treatment options, we illustrate the additional value and evidence of network meta-analysis in clinical practice. In the current treatment landscape, the results of net-work meta-analysis may support evidence-based decisions and ultimately help to optimize treatment and outcomes of NTE MM patients.",,Hematology

The primary aim was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and fidelity of the intervention for kidney transplant recipients and professionals. The secondary aim was to explore preliminary effects on outcomes.MethodsA pilot study was conducted in 2015-2017 to evaluate the intervention. Nurse Practitioners (NP) guided recipients in assessing 14 life areas using the Self-Management Web. Participants were supported in developing self-regulation skills which can be applied to self-management of the illness. Strategies included goal setting, action planning, and promotion of motivation and self-efficacy. Adult recipients from an outpatient clinic of a Dutch University Hospital who underwent their transplant at least 1 month ago, were invited to participate. NPs, nephrologists and recipients were interviewed to assess feasibility, fidelity and implementation experience. Consultations were videoed and analysed to assess fidelity. To assess the preliminary effects, the intervention group completed baseline (T0) and follow-up (T1) questionnaires on self-management behavior, self-efficacy, quality of life and quality of care. A historical control group of kidney transplant recipients completed the same questionnaires at T1.ResultsTwenty-seven recipients agreed to participate in the intervention group, of which 24 completed the intervention and 16 completed baseline and follow-up surveys. The control group consisted of 33 recipients. Professionals and recipients appraised the open, holistic focus of the intervention as a welcome addition to standard care and felt that this helped to build a relationship of trust. Recipients also felt they became more competent in problem-solving skills. The within-group analysis showed no significant increase in patients' self-management skills. The between-groups analysis showed significantly higher medication adherence among the intervention group (P=0.03; G=0.81). The within-groups analysis showed a significantly higher perceived quality of care (P=0.02) in the intervention group.ConclusionThis holistic nurse-led self-management support intervention was found to be feasible and acceptable by professionals and recipients alike. This pilot had a small sample therefore further research is needed into the potential effects on self-management behavior and well-being of transplant recipients.

Many aspects may influence such decision-making. We conducted a cross-sectional survey (NCT01890447) of households and other close contacts of newborns aged <= 6 months (or of expectant mothers in their last trimester) in Spain and Italy, using an adaptive discrete-choice experiment questionnaire. Aims were to assess the relative importance of attributes influencing vaccine adoption, and to estimate variation in vaccine adoption rates and the impact of cost on vaccination rates. Six hundred and fifteen participants (Spain, n = 313; Italy, n = 302) completed the survey. Of 144 available questionnaire scenarios, the most frequently selected (14% of respondents in both countries) were infant protection by household vaccination at vaccination center, recommendation by family physician and health authorities, with information available on leaflets and websites. The attribute with highest median relative importance was 'reduction in source of infection' in Spain (23.1%) and 'vaccination location' in Italy (18.8%). Differences between other attributes were low in both countries, with media attributes showing low importance. Over 80% of respondents indicated a definite or probable response to vaccine adoption (at no-cost) with estimated probability of adoption of 89-98%; applying vaccine costs (25euro per person) would reduce the probability of uptake by 7-20% in definite/probable respondents.

Stockouts can lead to treatment alterations or interruptions, which can impact treatment outcomes. This study investigates the determinants and effects of TB drug stockouts and whether poorer districts are disproportionately affected.MethodsTB stockout data, health system indicators and TB treatment outcomes at the district level were extracted from the District Health Barometer for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. Poverty terciles were constructed using the Census 2011 data to investigate whether stockouts and poor treatment outcomes were more prevalent in more impoverished districts. Fixed-effects regressions were used to estimate the effects of TB stockouts on TB treatment outcomes.ResultsTB stockouts occurred in all provinces but varied across provinces and years. Regression analysis showed a significant association between district per capita income and stockouts: a 10% rise in income was associated with an 8.50% decline in stockout proportions. In terms of consequences, after controlling for unobserved time invariant heterogeneity between districts, a 10% rise in TB drug stockouts was found to lower the cure rate by 2.10% (p<0.01) and the success rate by 1.42% (p<0.01). These effects were found to be larger in poorer districts.ConclusionsThe unequal spread of TB drug stockouts adds to the socioeconomic inequality in TB outcomes. Not only are stockouts more prevalent in poorer parts of South Africa, they also have a more severe impact on TB treatment outcomes in poorer districts. This suggests that efforts to cut back TB drug stockouts would not only improve TB treatment outcomes on average, they are also likely to improve equity because a disproportionate share of this burden is currently borne by the poorer districts.",Equity,Health Care Sciences & Services

In the conventional Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) models, which comprise utility for quality and length of life, loss aversion is not taken into account. When measuring elements of the QALY model, commonly, the (implicit) assumption is that utility for length and quality of life are independent. First attempts to quantify loss aversion for QALYs typically measured loss aversion in the context of life duration, keeping quality of life constant (or vice versa). However, given that QALYs are multi-attribute utilities, it may be possible that the degree of loss aversion is dependent on, or inseparable from, quality of life and non-constant. We test this assumption using non-parametric methodology to quantify loss aversion, under different levels of quality of life. We measure utility of life duration for four health states within subjects, and present the results of a robustness test of loss aversion within the QALY model. We find loss aversion coefficients to be stable at the aggregate level, albeit with considerable heterogeneity at the individual level.

Study Setting/Data Sources This study is conducted in the context of the Dutch individual health insurance market. Administrative data on spending and risk characteristics (2011-2014) for the entire population (N = 16.6 m) as well as health survey data from a large sample (N = 387 k) are used. Study Design The indicator for being healthy is low spending in three consecutive prior years. ""Low spending"" is defined in three ways: belonging to the bottom 60%, 70%, or 80% of the annual spending distribution. Versions of the Dutch RE model 2017 with and without the indicator are compared on individual-level payment fit and, using the survey data, group-level payment fit. Principal Findings All three alternative models outperform the Dutch RE model 2017. However, significant unpriced risk heterogeneity remains. Compared with the 60% threshold, the 80% threshold comes with a larger improvement in fit but identifies a less selective group. Conclusions The performance of the RE model can be improved by adding an indicator for being healthy based on multiple-year low spending.

The social environment may play an important role in shaping health behaviors, we however, lack knowledge regarding the exact influence of the social environment on older persons' physical activity levels. This research therefore aims to identify the relationships of physical activity to enabling and disabling behaviors in the social environment among older people in the Netherlands.MethodsParticipants were randomly sampled from the Rotterdam municipality register and stratified by age group (70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and85years) and neighborhood (district). Of 2798 respondents, 1280 (46%) returned filled-in questionnaires. The Perceived Social Influence on Health Behavior (PSI-HB) instrument was used to assess the degree to which individuals' health behavior is influenced by those around them. Respondents were additionally asked about enabling and disabling behaviors in their social environments and how many days per week they were physically active. Physical activity scores ranged from 0 (not being physically active for 30min a day at all during the week) to 7 (being physically active every day of the week). Respondents with a score of 5 were considered to be physically active and those with a score of <5 as physically inactive.ResultsResults revealed that increasing age significantly contributed to physical inactivity within this older population. Lower educational level significantly decreased the odds of physical activity. After controlling for background characteristics results show enabling behaviors and utilitarian social influence significantly increased the odds of physical activity while disabling behaviour of the social environment contributed to physical inactivity. No significant associations were found with perceived social influence aspects value-expressive influence and informational influence.ConclusionActual enabling and disabling behaviors of actors in older people's social environments seem relevant for their physical activity levels, in positive and negative ways. In promoting active aging, consideration of the role of the social environment and ensuring that it is supportive of older people's physical activity are important.",Health behaviors,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Objectives: To assess which psychological instruments are currently used and which psychological constructs are known to have an impact on patients' preferences and health-related decisions including the formation of preferences and preference heterogeneity. Methods: A systematic database search was undertaken to identify relevant studies. From the selected studies, the following information was extracted: study objectives, study population, design, psychological dimensions investigated, and instruments used to measure psychological variables. Results: Thirty-three studies were identified that described the association between a psychological construct, measured using a validated instrument, and patients' preferences or health-related decisions. We identified 33 psychological instruments and 18 constructs, and categorized the instruments into 5 groups, namely, motivational factors, cognitive factors, individual differences, emotion and mood, and health beliefs. Conclusions: This review provides an overview of the psychological factors and related instruments in the context of patients' preferences and decisions in healthcare settings. Our results indicate that measures of health literacy, numeracy, and locus of control have an impact on health-related preferences and decisions. Within the category of constructs that could explain preference and decision heterogeneity, health locus of control is a strong predictor of decisions in several healthcare contexts and is useful to consider when designing a patient preference study. Future research should continue to explore the association of psychological constructs with preference formation and heterogeneity to build on these initial recommendations.",stated preferences,Health Care Sciences & Services

Robustness analyses are performed to test the sensitivity of the outcomes for particular specifications, sample selections, assumptions about the construction of R&D stocks, and variable definitions. Analyses based on Cobb-Douglas and translog production functions mostly yield statistically insignificant or negative returns. In these models we control for private and foreign R&D investments and the primary production factors. Models including additional controls, such as public capital, the stock of inward and outward foreign direct investment, and the shares of high-tech imports and exports, yield more positive returns.

We distinguished three categories of both positive and negative incentives to steer on quality: social, competitive and financial incentives. The overall picture emerging is that insurers are caught in a struggle between positive and negative incentives, with CEOs being more positive about the incentives to steer on quality than purchasers and marketers. At present, the social mission perceived by insurers seems to be their most important driver to invest in quality enhancement. However, whether or not the role of the social mission is sustainable in a competitive market remains unclear. Improving publicly available information on quality therefore seems to be crucially important for reinforcing the positive as well as counteracting the negative incentives insurers face with respect to enhancing quality of care.

In this paper we track a 2017 pilot by the Dutch Health and Youth Care Inspectorate that aimed to use experiential knowledge in risk regulation through engaging with clients of long-term elderly care homes. Through an ethnographic inquiry we evaluate the design of this pilot. We find how the pilot transforms selected clients into experts-by-experience through training and site visits. In this transformation, clients attempt, and fail, to bring to the fore their definitions of quality and safety, negating their potentially specific contributions. Paradoxically, in their attempts to expose valid new knowledge on the quality of care, the pilot constructs the experts-by-experience in such a way that this knowledge is unlikely to be opened up. Concurrently, we find that in their attempts to have their input seen as valid, experts-by-experience downplay the value of their experiential knowledge. Thus, we show how dominating, legitimated interpretations of (knowledge about) quality of care resonate in experimental regulatory practices that explicitly try to move beyond them, emphasizing the need for a pragmatic and reflexive engagement with clients in the supervision of long-term elderly care.

Although studies support the validity of the ICECAP-O, it does not directly ask older people about their health. This raises questions about its ability to capture health indirectly. Previous studies found mixed results in this aspect, especially for physical health. This study further investigates whether the ICECAP-O indirectly includes health.MethodsUsing a cross-sectional design, a sampling agency retrieved data from 516 people aged 70 and older from the UK through an online questionnaire. The overlap in underlying constructs of the ICECAP-O and EQ-5D-5L was assessed using exploratory factor analysis. Spearman correlations and variance analysis were conducted by relating the ICECAP-O to measures of physical, mental and social functioning.ResultsThe ICECAP-O and EQ-5D-5L items loaded on two factors. Their overlap was limited, as four out of five EQ-5D-5L items loaded on the first factor, while four out of five ICECAP-O items loaded on the second. The ICECAP-O correlated highly with (mental and social functioning) health measures, and was able to differentiate between individuals with different scores on these measures. However, the correlation with the Barthel Index, a measure of physical functioning, was moderate.ConclusionsThe ICECAP-O may not fully cover all aspects of health. Therefore, a complementary health measure should be used in addition to the ICECAP-O to capture the full benefits of care interventions for older people in economic evaluations.",United Kingdom,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Methods A mixed-method participatory research approach (the Dialogue Model) was applied, including interviews (n = 19), four focus group discussions (n = 27), a questionnaire (n = 146) and a stakeholder dialogue meeting (n = 30) with patients in the Netherlands. Results Patients' physical discomfort, psychosocial issues, problems with the healthcare system and policy issues were highlighted. Respondents prioritise research aimed at factors potentially influencing survival, such as lifestyle, and research aimed at improving patients' quality of life, for example improving memory and concentration problems. Topics also focused on physical discomfort, causal mechanisms, and healthcare organisation and policies. Research of a social scientific character is underrepresented, and as such, patients' everyday problems are not all directly reflected in the research agenda.

We evaluated the projected impact of alternative RSAs for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapies based on real-world data. Methods: Data on treatment patterns of Dutch NSCLC patients from four different hospitals were used to perform ""what-if"" analyses, evaluating the costs and benefits likely associated with various RSAs. In the scenarios, drug costs or refunds were based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) response, survival compared to the pivotal trial, treatment duration, or a fixed cost per patient. Analyses were done for erlotinib, gemcitabine/cisplatin, and pemetrexed/platinum for metastatic NSCLC, and gemcitabine/cisplatin, pemetrexed/cisplatin, and vinorelbine/cisplatin for nonmetastatic NSCLC. Results: Money-back guarantees led to moderate cost reductions to the payer. For conditional treatment continuation schemes, costs and outcomes associated with the different treatments were dispersed. When price was linked to the outcome, the payer's drug costs reduced by 2.5% to 26.7%. Discounted treatment initiation schemes yielded large cost reductions. Utilization caps mainly reduced the costs of erlotinib treatment (by 16%). Given a fixed cost per patient based on projected average use of the drug, risk sharing was unfavorable to the payer because of the lower than projected use. The impact of RSAs on a national scale was dispersed. Conclusions: For erlotinib and pemetrexed/platinum, large cost reductions were observed with risk sharing. RSAs can mitigate uncertainty around the incremental cost-effectiveness or budget impact of drugs, but only when the type of arrangement matches the setting and type of uncertainty.

The systematic differences between the study arms allowed for a direct comparison of dropout rates and cognitive debriefing scores and accommodated the quantitative comparison of respondents' choice consistency using a heteroskedastic mixed logit model. Our results indicate that the introduction of level overlap made it significantly easier for respondents to identify the differences and choose between the choice options. As a stand-alone design strategy, attribute level overlap reduced the dropout rate by 30%, increased the level of choice consistency by 30%, and avoided learning effects in the initial choice tasks of the DCE. The combination of level overlap and color coding was even more effective: It reduced the dropout rate by 40% to 50% and increased the level of choice consistency by more than 60%.

The primary aim of OnkoNetwork is the improvement of clinical outcomes via timely access to quality assured and defragmented healthcare services. The Horizon 2020 funded SELFIE project has selected OnkoNetwork for in-depth qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The aim of this study was to provide a qualitative evaluation of OnkoNetwork along the six components of the SELFIE conceptual framework: 1) service delivery, 2) leadership and governance, 3) workforce, 4) financing, 5) technologies and medical products, and 6) information and research.MethodsAnalysis of published and grey programme documentation, followed by 20 semi-structured interviews with representatives of programme initiators, general and financial managers, involved physicians and non-physician professionals, patients and their informal caregivers. Transcripts of all interviews were analysed by Mayring's content analysis method by two independent researchers.ResultsThis study yielded the first comprehensive description of the programme. OnkoNetwork is a blue dahila in Central and Eastern Europe, providing timely and quality-assured healthcare services for the target patients by personalized patient path monitoring and management in a financially sustainable manner without macro-level financing of its operation. Innovative professional roles were implemented for non-physicians and physicians, and a supporting information technology application was developed.ConclusionsThis paper provides a systematic description of OnkoNetwork on the six components of the SELFIE conceptual framework for integrated care in multimorbidity to understand how and why OnkoNetwork was implemented and cares (better) for its patients. Because integrated care models are designed and adjusted to their specific local needs and context, those few successful and sustainable models that were established in Central and Eastern European countries represent important benchmarks for other initiatives in this region. Experience with OnkoNetwork during its planning, implementation and operation including the description of key success factors and barriers as perceived by various stakeholder groups, may support the development of further integrated care models especially in countries with similar economic status and healthcare settings.",Thick description,Health Care Sciences & Services

We draw upon a regression discontinuity design to extrapolate effects to the cut-off age 18 and incorporate the size of the cost-sharing scheme. Our estimate shows that for individuals around the age of eighteen, one euro of the deductible reduces healthcare expenditures 18 eurocents more than one euro of the rebate. This demonstrates that different designs of a cost-sharing scheme can have substantially different effects on total healthcare expenditure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we summarize the theoretical debates and empirical research in this area and highlight the conclusions that can be drawn for current practice. For future related and future unrelated medical costs, the literature suggests that inclusion is required to obtain optimal outcomes from available resources. This conclusion does not depend on the perspective adopted by the decision maker. Future non-medical costs are only relevant when adopting a societal perspective; these should be included if the benefits of non-medical consumption and production are also included in the evaluation. Whether this is the case currently remains unclear, given that benefits are typically quantified in quality-adjusted life-years and only limited research has been performed on the extent to which these (implicitly) capture benefits beyond health. Empirical research has shown that the impact of including future costs can be large, and that estimation of such costs is feasible. In practice, however, future unrelated medical costs and future unrelated non-medical consumption costs are typically excluded from economic evaluations. This is explicitly prescribed in some pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Further research is warranted on the development and improvement of methods for the estimation of future costs. Standardization of methods is needed to enhance the practical applicability of inclusion for the analyst and the comparability of the outcomes of different studies. For future non-medical costs, further research is also needed on the extent to which benefits related to this spending are captured in the measurement and valuation of health benefits, and how to broaden the scope of the evaluation if they are not sufficiently captured.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

However, increasing support does not necessarily result in increasing quality. Although specific reviews have been conducted in certain contexts, there exists no recent description of the general state of the science of health-related DCEs. The aim of this paper was to update prior reviews (1990-2012), to identify all health-related DCEs and to provide a description of trends, current practice and future challenges.MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted to identify health-related empirical DCEs published between 2013 and 2017. The search strategy and data extraction replicated prior reviews to allow the reporting of trends, although additional extraction fields were incorporated.ResultsOf the 7877 abstracts generated, 301 studies met the inclusion criteria and underwent data extraction. In general, the total number of DCEs per year continued to increase, with broader areas of application and increased geographic scope. Studies reported using more sophisticated designs (e.g. D-efficient) with associated software (e.g. Ngene). The trend towards using more sophisticated econometric models also continued. However, many studies presented sophisticated methods with insufficient detail. Qualitative research methods continued to be a popular approach for identifying attributes and levels.ConclusionsThe use of empirical DCEs in health economics continues to grow. However, inadequate reporting of methodological details inhibits quality assessment. This may reduce decision-makers' confidence in results and their ability to act on the findings.

Second, the logistics service provider is allowed a certain slack time for the delivery of the failed good to the repair shop. Third, a failed good is only admitted periodically to the shop and collection and transportation ensures that the failed good is available in the repair shop at the start of the first period possible. We ask under what conditions a transportation slack time, either as a constant slack or as a periodic admission to the repair shop, can be beneficial. We present analytical solutions for immediate transportation and transportation with a constant time slack considering costs.

An empirical assessment of adaptation to functional limitations in an older population,"Chronic diseases and functional limitations may have serious and persistent consequences for one's quality of life (QoL). Over time, however, their negative impact on QoL may diminish because of adaptation. Understanding how much people adapt helps to correctly separate the effects attributable to interventions from those arising from adaptation and thus facilitates a better estimation of the effects of disease and treatment on QoL. To date, however, there is little empirical evidence on adaptation in older populations. In particular, it is unclear to which extent dimensions of QoL like health and overall experience with life are influenced by adaptation. This paper studies adaptation to functional limitations in 5000 respondents of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) who develop disabilities during the span of the 5 waves of data collection between 2004 and 2015. To examine the association between time since the onset of functional limitations and self-perceived health and life satisfaction, a fixed effects ordered logit model is used. We found evidence supporting adaptation in life satisfaction, corresponding to a return to pre-onset levels of life satisfaction. Also in the self-perceived health dimension, adaptation does occur, but it does not occur fast enough to offset the negative changes in underlying health. This means that observational studies that measure one of these two outcome measures should be aware that part or all of the effects found are due to adaptation.",Fixed effects ordered logit,Biomedical Social Sciences

Current healthcare delivery is not tailored to the needs of patients with multi-morbidity, although multi-morbidity poses a heavy burden on patients and is related to adverse outcomes. Patient-centered care and co-creation of care are expected to improve outcomes, but the relationships among patient-centered care, co-creation of care, physical well-being, social well-being, and satisfaction with care among patients with multi-morbidity are not known.MethodsIn 2017, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 216 (of 394 eligible participants; 55% response rate) patients with multi-morbidity from eight primary care practices in Noord-Brabant, the Netherlands. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to identify relationships among patient-centered care, co-creation of care, physical well-being, social well-being, and satisfaction with care.ResultsThe mean age of the patients was 74.4610.64 (range, 47-94) years. Less than half (40.8%) of the patients were male, 43.3% were single, and 39.3% were less educated. Patient-centered care and co-creation of care were correlated significantly with patients' physical well-being, social well-being, and satisfaction with care (all p0.001).

To establish whether households remain economically vulnerable to illness after the introduction of universal health coverage (UHC), we examine the impact of health shocks of different severity on informal workers in Thailand who are entitled to comprehensive public medical care but lack social protection of earnings. Using three years of panel data, we find that the most severe illness that strikes an initially healthy worker reduces household earnings by almost one third and, despite UHC, raises out-of-pocket spending on medical care by around two thirds. However, households are able to protect spending on goods other than medical care by drawing on informal insurance, credit and savings. These coping strategies substitute for the lack of formal earnings insurance and fill gaps in the effective health care coverage. On average, the combination of UHC and informal insurance of the residual risks does a reasonably good job of protecting living standards from the economic impact of illness, at least in the short term.

In this study, we examine whether having more children and grandchildren is protective against later life loneliness in a group of Eastern and Western European countries. Drawing on data from the Generation and Gender Surveys, we estimated logistic regression models of the likelihood of being lonely among men and women aged 65 and older. The results showed a negative association between number of children and loneliness among men and women in both Eastern-European and Western-European countries. A mediation analysis performed using the KHB decomposition method showed that grandparenthood status partly explained differences in the loneliness risks of childless women, mothers with one child and those with two or more children. Among men, the mediating role of grandparenthood was significant in Eastern Europe and marginally significant in Western countries. Given the relatively strong reliance of older people on the family in Eastern Europe, we expected that the protective effects of offspring on loneliness would be stronger in Eastern-European countries than in Western-European countries. This hypothesis was supported only in part by our results. The protective effect of having four or more children was larger in the East than in the West. Overall, our findings indicate that having close family members, including more children and at least one grandchild, has a protective effect against later-life loneliness in both country clusters considered.",grandparenthood,Family Studies

However, due to the rapid ageing of population in the next decades future demand for institutional care is likely to increase. In this paper we perform a scenario analysis to examine the potential impact of these two opposite trends on the demand for institutional elderly care in the Netherlands. We find that the demand for institutional care first declines as a result of the expected increase in the number of low-need elderly that age-in-place. This effect is strong at first but then peters out. After this first period the effect of the demographic trend takes over, resulting in an increase in demand for institutional care. We argue that the observed trends are likely to result in a growing mismatch between demand and supply of institutional care. Whereas the current stock of institutional care is primarily focussed on low-need (residential) care, future demand will increasingly consist of high-need (nursing home) care for people with cognitive as well as somatic disabilities. We discuss several policy options to reduce the expected mismatch between supply and demand for institutional care.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

We searched nine databases for eligible studies until May 2016 with a comparison group and reporting at least one outcome regarding effectiveness or cost-effectiveness.

We assessed the quality of the included studies with the Effective Practice and Organization of Care risk-of-bias tool. The interventions were described following Rainbow Model of Integrated Care framework by Valentijn. Our systematic review reveals that the majority of the reported outcomes in the studies on preventive, integrated care show no effects. In terms of health outcomes, effectiveness is demonstrated most often for seldom-reported outcomes such as well-being. Outcomes regarding informal caregivers and professionals are rarely considered and negligible. Most promising are the care process outcomes that did improve for preventive, integrated care interventions as compared to usual care. Healthcare utilisation was the most reported outcome but we found mixed results. Evidence for cost-effectiveness is limited. High expectations should be tempered given this limited and fragmented evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of preventive, integrated care for frail older people.

The objectives of this article were to (1) critically assess whether the widespread adoption of the EQ-5D and its time trade-off-based value sets to inform economic evaluation is likely to continue and (2) speculate about how benefits may be measured and valued to inform economic evaluation in the future. Evidence supports the use of the EQ-5D in many areas of health, but there are notable gaps. Furthermore, there has been interest among some policy makers in measuring changes in well-being, and in using common outcomes across sectors. Possibilities for measuring well-being alongside health can be achieved through bolt-on dimensions or an entirely new measure capturing both health and well-being. Nevertheless, there are significant concerns about the logic of estimating a common utility function. The development of online valuation methods has had a major impact on the field, which is likely to continue. We, however, recommend more allowance for respondents to consider their answers. There is an ongoing debate on the role of patient values or experience-based values. To date, this has seen limited take-up by decision makers and there are significant technical problems to obtaining representative and meaningful values. Policy makers and the general population must decide on the focus and scope of benefits that are incorporated into economic evaluation, and current evidence on this is mixed. In part, this will determine whether the widespread adoption will continue. Copyright (c) 2019, ISPOR-The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the psychological control dimension has rarely been explicitly modelled and there is limited insight into joint parenting styles that simultaneously characterize maternal and paternal practices and their impact on child development. Using data from a sample of 600 Flemish families raising an 8-to-10 year old child, we identified naturally occurring joint parenting styles. A cluster analysis based on two parenting dimensions (parental support and behavioral control) revealed four congruent parenting styles: an authoritative, positive authoritative, authoritarian and uninvolved parenting style. A subsequent cluster analysis comprising three parenting dimensions (parental support, behavioral and psychological control) yielded similar cluster profiles for the congruent (positive) authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles, while the fourth parenting style was relabeled as a congruent intrusive parenting style. ANOVAs demonstrated that having (positive) authoritative parents associated with the most favorable outcomes, while having authoritarian parents coincided with the least favorable outcomes. Although less pronounced than for the authoritarian style, having intrusive parents also associated with poorer child outcomes. Results demonstrated that accounting for parental psychological control did not yield additional parenting styles, but enhanced our understanding of the pattern among the three parenting dimensions within each parenting style and their association with child outcomes. More similarities than dissimilarities in the parenting of both parents emerged, although adding psychological control slightly enlarged the differences between the scores of mothers and fathers.",School-aged children,Psychiatry

This paper takes a close look at representation to find out if and how it can strengthen local democracy. Non-electoral representation, as manifested by representative claims based on non-electoral grounds, such as identity and expertise, made by local councillors, as well as non-elected individuals and organisations, might serve to mitigate democratic problems. We empirically study manifestations of electoral and non-electoral representation and their interactions.

In both countries, the supplementary fee system is under pressure because of financial sustainability concerns and a lack of added value for the patient. Expenditure on supplementary fees is increasing much faster than total health expenditure. So far, measures taken to curb this trend have not been successful. For certain categories of physicians, supplementary fees represent one-third of total income. For patients, however, the added value of supplementary fees is not that clear. Supplementary fees can buy comfort and access to physicians who refuse to treat patients who are not willing to pay supplementary fees. Perceived quality of care plays an important role in patients' willingness to pay supplementary fees. Today, there is no evidence that physicians who charge supplementary fees provide better quality of care than physicians who do not. However, linking supplementary fees to objectively proven quality of care and limiting access to top quality care to patients able and willing to pay supplementary fees might not be socially acceptable in many countries. Our conclusion is that supplementary physicians' fees are not sustainable.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

The objective of this research is to estimate a k-threshold based on the marginal returns to cardiovascular disease (CVD) hospital care in the Netherlands. To estimate a k-threshold for hospital care on CVD, we proceed in two steps: First, we estimate the impact of hospital spending on mortality using a Bayesian regression modelling framework, using data on CVD mortality and CVD hospital spending by age and gender for the period 1994-2010. Second, we use life tables in combination with quality of life data to convert these estimates into a k-threshold expressed in euros per quality-adjusted life year gained. Our base case estimate resulted in an estimate of 41,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. In our sensitivity analyses, we illustrated how the incorporation of prior evidence into the estimation pushes estimates downwards. We conclude that our base case estimate of the k-threshold may serve as a benchmark value for decision making in the Netherlands as well as for future research regarding k-thresholds.",threshold,Health Care Sciences & Services

Therefore, investigating factors that influence compliance may provide better insights into how regulators can be more effective. This study aimed to find out if medical students' perceptions of regulation in the United Arab Emirates are associated with self-reported regulatory compliance.MethodsIn the cross-sectional study, we administered a structured questionnaire to students of medicine with different statements concerning their perceptions of healthcare regulation and self-reported compliance. The statements included statement regarding the legitimacy, fairness and regulatory performance, as well as the risk to getting caught and being punished. The association between perceptions and self-reported compliance was analyzed using multiple regression models.ResultsOne hundred and six Year 3 and 4 pre-clinical medicine students (56.4% response rate) completed the survey. Almost 40% of the students rated their level of awareness and understanding of regulation as Good or Very Good., despite their lack of direct contact with the regulatory authorities (less than 10% reported monthly or more frequent contact). Self-reported compliance was high with almost 85% of the students either agreeing or strongly agreeing with the four compliance statements (mean score 4.1 out of 5). The findings suggest that positive perceptions of the regulator's performance ( 0.27; 95% CI 0.13-0.41), fairness of the regulatory processes ( 0.25; 95% CI 0.11-0.38) and its legitimacy ( 0.23; 95% CI 0.05-0.41), are stronger associated with compliance than the perceived risks of getting caught and being punished ( 0.10; 95% CI -0.04 - 0.23).ConclusionsTo improve compliant behavior, healthcare regulators should pay more attention to their own perceived performance, as well as the perceived fairness and legitimacy of their regulatory processes rather than focusing on more traditional methods of deterrence, such as perceived risk of getting caught and being published.",Healthcare regulation,Education & Educational Research

This term is surrounded with positive rhetoric and promises about the ability to analyse real-world data quickly and comprehensively. Such rhetoric is highly consequential in shaping debates on Big Data. While the fields of Science and Technology Studies and Critical Data Studies have been instrumental in elaborating the neglected and problematic dimensions of Big Data, it remains an open question how and to what extent such insights become embedded in other fields. In this paper, we analyse the epistemological claims that accompany Big Data in the healthcare domain. We systematically searched scientific literature and selected 206 editorials as these reflect on developments in the domain. Through an interpretive analysis, we construct five ideal-typical discourses that all frame Big Data in specific ways. Three of the discourses (the modernist, instrumentalist and pragmatist) frame Big Data in positive terms and disseminate a compelling rhetoric. Metaphors of 'capturing', 'illuminating' and 'harnessing' data presume that Big Data are benign and leading to valid knowledge. The scientist and critical-interpretive discourses question the objectivity and effectivity claims of Big Data. Metaphors of 'selecting' and 'constructing' data illustrate another political message, framing Big Data as limited. We conclude that work in the critical-interpretive discourse has not broadly infiltrated the medical domain.

Risk selection can occur in the presence of unpriced risk heterogeneity, which refers to predictable variation in health care spending not reflected in either premiums by insurers or risk equalization payments. This paper examines unpriced risk heterogeneity within risk groups distinguished by the sophisticated Dutch risk equalization model of 2016. Our strategy is to combine the administrative dataset used for estimation of the risk equalization model (n=16.9 million) with information derived from a large health survey (n=387k). The survey information allows for explaining and predicting residual spending of the risk equalization model. Based on the predicted residual spending, two metrics are used to indicate unpriced risk heterogeneity at the individual level and at the level of certain (risk) groups: the correlation coefficient between residual spending and predicted residual spending, and the mean absolute value of predicted residual spending. The analyses yield three main findings: (1) the health survey information is able to explain some residual spending of the risk equalization model, (2) unpriced risk heterogeneity exists both in morbidity and in non-morbidity groups, and (3) unpriced risk heterogeneity increases with predicted spending by the risk equalization model. These findings imply that the sophisticated Dutch risk equalization model does not completely remove unpriced risk heterogeneity. Further improvement of the model should focus on broadening and refining the current set of morbidity-based risk adjusters.",Survey data,Health Care Sciences & Services

Methods: A total of 2350 older Turkish migrants aged > 65 years residing in Rotterdam, the Netherlands were identified using the municipal register of which 680 respondents completed the questionnaires (response rate of 32%). Results: Average age of the respondents was 72.90 (standard deviation 5.02) (range 66-95) years and about half of them were women (47.6%). The majority of respondents reported having a low education (80.3%), low income level (83.4%), is chronically ill (90.6%), overweight (86.5%) and about half obese (46.0%). More than half of the respondents eat enough fruit (58.2%) and vegetables per week (55.3%). About a third of the respondents smoke (33.5%) and 43.0% can be considered to be physically active. Looking at the health behaviours a weak positive relationship was found between eating enough vegetables and well-being (beta = 0.14; P = 0.017). In addition, weak relationships were found between physical activity and depressive symptoms (beta = -0.16; P = 0.007), smoking and depressive symptoms (beta = 0.16; P = 0.009) and self-management abilities and physical health (beta = 0.17; P = 0.015). Strongest relationships were found between self-management abilities and depressive symptoms (beta = -0.39; P < 0.001) and self-management abilities with overall well-being (beta = 0.49; P < 0.001). Conclusions: From this study, we can conclude that next to health behaviours broader self-management abilities to maintain overall well-being are important for Turkish older people.

A sample of 945 community-dwelling older adults living in Rotterdam's districts Lombardijen, Lage Land/Prinsenland, Oude Westen, and Vreewijk was asked to complete a questionnaire in 2013. A total of 588 (62%) responded. The majority (56%) of respondents was female, 19% had low educational levels, 35% were married, and 85% were born in the Netherlands. Mean age was 77.1 +/- 5.3 (range 70-93) years. Levels of age-friendliness and older people's ability to realize the instrumental goals to achieve overall well-being varied tremendously among neighborhoods, with older people living in less age-friendly communities reporting lower levels of well-being. These differences in well-being resulted especially from differences in affection, behavioral confirmation, and comfort. Higher-educated older persons were more critical regarding the domains civic participation, transportation, and communication and information in their neighborhoods, suggesting a socioeconomic gradient in the perceived lack of neighborhood attributes facilitating aging in place. Currently, physical and social neighborhood attributes enabling aging in place seem to satisfy the needs for affection, behavioral confirmation, and comfort in some, but not all, neighborhoods. Levels of age-friendliness in neighborhoods did not explain differences in opportunities for older people to realize the instrumental goals of status and stimulation.",Older people,Social Sciences - Other Topics

Included studies investigated (health-related) quality of life or well-being of individuals with fertility problems. The applied instruments were assessed, as were the outcomes and suitability for use in cost-utility studies.Results: Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Twelve distinct instruments of measurement were applied: two generic quality-of-life instruments, five generic well-being instruments and five disease-specific instruments. Most studies found negative associations in one or more domains assessing fertility problems and quality of life or well-being. However, two studies found the opposite. None of the studies reported outcomes relevant for cost-utility studies.Conclusion: Quality of life and well-being related to having fertility problems are regularly studied. However, the reported information is not suitable for use in cost-utility studies. There is a clear need for studies investigating the impact of fertility problems on quality of life in a way that outcomes can be compared across studies and disease areas.",well-being,Obstetrics & Gynecology

Empirical evidence suggests that people's preferences are affected by ambiguity. Health economic analyses generally ignore ambiguity preferences and assume that they are the same as preferences under risk. We show how health preferences can be measured under ambiguity, and we compare them with health preferences under risk. We assume a general ambiguity model that includes many of the ambiguity models that have been proposed in the literature. For health gains, ambiguity preferences and risk preferences were indeed the same. For health losses, they differed with subjects being more pessimistic in decision under ambiguity. Utility and loss aversion were the same for risk and ambiguity. Our results imply that reducing the clinical ambiguity of health losses has more impact than reducing the ambiguity of health gains, that utilities elicited with known probabilities may not carry over to an ambiguous setting, and that ambiguity aversion may impact value of information analyses if losses are involved. These findings are highly relevant for medical decision making, because most medical interventions involve losses.",health,Health Care Sciences & Services

While interpretative phenomenological analysis focuses on experiences and illness narratives of patients, but not on therapist's understanding of those, patient-provider communication surveys focus primarily on effective forms of communication without addressing the actual illness experiences of patients. There is a need for empirical research that combines both strands to investigate not only the experiences of patients but also whether professionals are able to understand these. This study combined both strands by means of a novel research method called the Imitation Game (combined with other qualitative methods). This sociological method was developed to investigate what different social groups know of each other's lifeworld. It focused on the important domain of eating disorder treatment to investigate whether therapists were able to understand the experiences of their patients and vice versa. This study provides insights into the domains in which therapists and patients were able to develop insights into each other's experiential knowledge (and where they had difficulties in doing so). The findings also implicate the high potential of the Imitation Game as an interdisciplinary research method. We propose that the Imitation Game may be particularly valuable as a can opener' that enables the development of in-depth, qualitative insights into the substantive themes that matter in the lifeworlds of patients and therapists.",research methodology,Biomedical Social Sciences

We followed recommendations from the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research-Society of Medical Decision Making (ISPOR-SMDM) Modeling Good Research Practices Task Force-2. The process involved scoping the decision problem by a working group and drafting a preliminary cost-effectiveness model framework. A systematic literature review (SLR) of existing decision-analytic models was performed and analysis of an RA registry was conducted to inform the structure of the draft conceptual model. Finally, an expert panel was convened to seek input on the draft conceptual model. The proposed conceptual model consists of three separate modules: 1) patient characteristic module, 2) treatment module, and 3) outcome module. Consistent with the scope, the conceptual model proposed six changes to current economic models in RA. These changes proposed are to: 1) use composite measures of disease activity to evaluate treatment response as well as disease progression (at least two measures should be considered, one as the base case and one as a sensitivity analysis); 2) conduct utility mapping based on disease activity measures; 3) incorporate subgroups based on guideline-recommended prognostic factors; 4) integrate realistic treatment patterns based on clinical practice/registry datasets; 5) assimilate outcomes that are not joint related (extra-articular outcomes); and 6) assess mortality based on disease activity. We proposed a conceptual model that incorporates the current understanding of clinical and real-world evidence in RA, as well as of existing modeling assumptions. The proposed model framework was reviewed with experts and could serve as a foundation for developing future cost-effectiveness models in RA.",,Science & Technology - Other Topics

A sub set of data from a patient survey conducted as part of the MUNROS programme of work was used. The overall survey aim was to describe and quantify the use of new professionals and new roles for established health care professionals other than medical doctors, in primary and secondary care sectors in three care pathways in nine European countries Ordered logit models were used to investigate the association between: (1) patient satisfaction with the last visit; (2) with their care provider; (3) with the information provided and a set of covariates explaining the involvement of new professional roles in three clinical pathways: type 2 diabetes, heart disease and breast cancer. For patients with breast cancer, high levels of satisfaction are associated with the involvement of new professions/professional roles in the provision of conditions specific education and monitoring. For patients with heart disease, the involvement of new professions/professional roles is likely to have a negative impact on satisfaction. For patients with Type 2 diabetes results are ambivalent. Patients belonging to countries experiencing innovative models of healthcare delivery and with high levels of involvement of new professions/professional roles are generally more satisfied. In conclusion, the introduction of new professions does not affect patient satisfaction negatively, therefore introducing new health professional roles is a pursuable strategy from a patient satisfaction perspective, at least for breast cancer and type 2 diabetes.

The assumption is that ""selective contracting"" will stimulate efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation and will diminish overcapacity. In 2010, the first Dutch health insurers started experimenting with ""selective contracting"" by setting a minimum treatment volume per year for complex treatments. In an explorative, multiple case study among 15 hospitals in five regions, we found that instead of competing, hospitals started to cooperate and strengthen their networks. The government intended to remove redundant hospital capacity and improve quality by stimulating specialization and concentration. Our study showed that specialization was indeed stimulated, which may have increased quality of care. However, facilitated by the absence of a countervailing power (government or insurer), hospitals in our cases negotiated to the effect of preserving hospital capacity. Within the current political debate between supporters of competition and advocates of a national health service, the importance and role of the (medical) networks should be taken into account. Otherwise, the outcomes of health care governance will be different than intended by either party.",selective contracting,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Using Anchoring Vignettes to Uncover Health Disparities by Wealth and Race,"In spite of the wide disparities in wealth and in objective health measures like mortality, observed inequality by wealth in self-reported health appears to be nearly nonexistent in low- to middle-income settings. To determine the extent to which this is driven by reporting tendencies, we use anchoring vignettes to test and correct for reporting heterogeneity in health among elderly South Africans. Significant reporting differences across wealth groups are detected. Poorer individuals rate the same health state description more positively than richer individuals. Only after we correct for these differences does a significant and substantial health disadvantage of the poor emerge. We also find that health inequality and reporting heterogeneity are confounded by race. Within race groups-especially among black Africans and to a lesser degree among whites-heterogeneous reporting leads to an underestimation of health inequalities between richest and poorest. More surprisingly, we also show that the correction may go in the opposite direction: the apparent black African (vs. white) health disadvantage within the top wealth quintile almost disappears after we correct for reporting tendencies. Such large shifts and even reversals of health gradients have not been documented in previous studies on reporting bias in health inequalities. The evidence for South Africa, with its history of racial segregation and socioeconomic inequality, highlights that correction for reporting matters greatly when using self-reported health measures in countries with such wide disparities.",South Africa,Demography

We conducted a series of hypothetical elicitations over health outcomes associated with different self-management behaviours from a population of individuals with or without 'manageable' chronic disease (n = 120). We observed risk aversion in both the gain and the loss domains, as welt as significant loss aversion.

We investigated time and resource use for hospitals and patients and compared healthcare and societal costs for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration of trastuzumab and rituximab. Data for the preparation and administration of both drugs were collected at the hospital pharmacy and at the oncology day care unit. Patients completed a questionnaire for obtaining information on societal costs (productivity losses, informal care and traveling expenses). A total of 126 patients were recruited in six hospitals; 82 received trastuzumab (37 IV and 45 SC) and 44 received rituximab (23 IV and 21 SC). The costs per administration (including societal cost but excluding drug costs) were Euro167 and Euro264 for IV and Euro76 and Euro146 for SC trastuzumab and rituximab, respectively. The costs for SC administration were lower in all categories. The largest cost component was related to time spent at the day care unit (overhead costs). This resulted in savings of Euro47 for SC trastuzumab and Euro69 for SC rituximab. The costs related to time of healthcare professionals was Euro9 lower for both drugs. The costs for consumables resulted in another Euro12 savings. Societal costs were Euro22 lower for SC trastuzumab and Euro28 lower for SC rituximab. Although administration costs are relatively a small part of the total costs, important savings can be generated by switching to an SC route of administration especially because a large number of patients receive oncology drugs and patients receive more than one administration.",trastuzumab,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

We develop a framework where the objective of risk-adjustment is to minimize the efficiency loss from service-level distortions due to adverse selection, and we use the framework to develop a welfare-grounded method for estimating risk-adjustment weights. We show that when the number of risk adjustor variables exceeds the number of decisions plans make about service allocations, incentives for service-level distortion can always be eliminated via a constrained least-squares regression. When the number of plan service-level allocation decisions exceeds the number of risk-adjusters, the optimal weights can be found by an OLS regression on a straightforward transformation of the data.

Byinviting POs that claim to represent patients, representation comes into being. However, little is known about the circumstances under which governments accept POs as patient representatives. Based on the analysis of relevant legislation, this article investigates the criteria that self-help organizations (SHOs), a special type of PO, must fulfil in order to be accepted as patient representatives by governments in Austria and Germany. Thereby, it aims to contribute to the discussion on the role of governments in steering SHOs. There are different degrees of regulation (very little in Austria, more in Germany). Governments in both countries not only formulate explicit criteria for SHOs with respect to patient representation but also guide SHOs representing patients through implicit criteria for associations. We discuss the findings against concepts of responsiveness, authorization, and accountability. Our findings indicate that governmental steering is not negative per se as indicated by previous research butdepending on legislative criteriacan promote transparency and democratic quality in patient representation.",Independence,Biomedical Social Sciences

However, this study shows how opinion-making physicians in strategic arenas (i.e. national professional bodies, conferences and high-impact journals) advocate to reform medical professionalism by discursively framing physicians as leaders. The aim of this article is to critically investigate the use of leadership discourse by these opinion-making physicians. By performing a discursive analysis of key documents produced in these strategic arenas and additional observations of national conferences, this article investigates how leadership discourse is used and to what purpose. The following key uses of medical leadership discourses were identified: (1) regaining the lead in medical professionalism, (2) disrupting 'old' professional values, and (3) constructing the 'modem' physician. The analysis reveals that physicians as 'leaders' are expected to become team-players that work across disciplinary and organizational boundaries to improve the quality and affordability of care. In comparison to management that is negatively associated with NPM reform, leadership discourse is linked to positive institutional change, such as decentralization and integration of care. Yet, it is unclear to what extent leadership discourses are actually incorporated on the work floor and to what effect. Future studies could therefore investigate the uptake of leadership discourses by rank and file physicians to investigate whether leadership discourses are used in restricting or empowering ways.",Physicians,Biomedical Social Sciences

Alternative payment mechanisms, such as bundled payments, have been introduced without uniform definitions, and existing payment typologies are not suitable for describing them. We use a systematic review combined with example integrated care programmes identified from practice in the Horizon2020 SELFIE project to inform a new typology of payment mechanisms for integrated care. The typology describes payments in terms of the scope of payment (Target population, Time, Sectors), the participation of providers (Provider coverage, Financial pooling/sharing), and the single provider/patient involvement (Income, Multiple disease/needs focus, and Quality measurement). There is a gap between rhetoric on the need for new payment mechanisms and those implemented in practice. Current payments for integrated care are mostly sector- and disease-specific, with questionable impact on those with the most need for integrated care. The typology provides a basis to improve financial incentives supporting more effective and efficient integrated care systems. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

The impact of these trends on patients' travel burden is often ignored. This study charts the effects of different scenarios of centralising surgery on the travel burden for patients with cancer of the digestive tract, particularly among vulnerable patient groups. Our analyses include all surgically treated Dutch patients with colorectal, stomach or oesophageal cancer diagnosed in 2012-2013. After determining each patient's actual travel burden, simulations explored the impact of continued centralisation of cancer surgery under four hypothetical scenarios. Compared to patients' actual travelling, simulated travel distances under relatively 'conservative' scenarios did not necessarily increase, most likely due to current hospital bypassing. Using multivariable regression analyses, as a first exercise, it is examined whether the potential effects on travel burden differ across patient groups. For some cancer types, under more extreme scenarios increases in travel distances are significantly higher for older patients and those with a low SES. Given the potential impact on vulnerable patients' travel burden, our analysis suggests a thorough consideration of non-clinical effects of centralisation in health policy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Background: Along with the perennial problems of unaffordable and inequitable healthcare, a rapidly ageing population and the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases pose challenges to the Chinese healthcare system. Recognising these challenges and to satisfy people's demands for more and better healthcare, China has initiated a plan, named 'Healthy China 2030', based on the findings from a two-year joint study by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank Group (WBG) in collaboration with Chinese agencies. The Chinese healthcare plan, officially approved in 2016, is an attempt to use the people-centred, integrated care (PCIC) model recommended by the WHO and WBG to shape the Chinese healthcare system. In accordance with PCIC, China began the implementation of gatekeeping primary care by introducing GP services to local communities. Methods: A comparative analysis was employed to point out the importance of introducing GP services. A systematic assessment was carried out to evaluate the regulatory sector of the Chinese healthcare system, including a critical review of related legal norms and a theoretical exploration of external impediments (eg, cultural attitudes, government capacity and interest groups). Findings: Results demonstrate that the current regulatory sector of the Chinese healthcare system needs to he improved in order to assist the nationwide implementation of GP services and to strengthen its gatekeeping role. Major deficiencies include the problematic relationship between legal norms and health policies, the lack of effective and consistent new legislation, the low rate of social acceptance, and lack of support from agencies. To address those challenges, this paper recommends that preliminary efforts be devoted, in part, to two changes in the legal structure: enacting a specific law, and creating an independent regulatory oversight body.",regulatory strategies,General & Internal Medicine

Objectives: The aim of this study was to introduce a general method of accommodating for nonlinear time preferences in discrete choice experiment (DCE) duration studies and to evaluate its impact on estimated QALY tariffs. Methods: A parsimonious utility function is proposed that accommodates any discounting function and preserves linear time preferences as a special case. Based on an efficient DCE design and 1775 respondents from a nationally representative scientific household panel, preferences and QALY tariffs for the Dutch SF-6D were estimated while accommodating for nonlinear time preferences via exponential and hyperbolic discounting functions. Results: When the discount rate was estimated directly, we found strong evidence of nonlinear time preferences (with an exponential and hyperbolic discount rate of 5.7% and 16.5%, respectively). When the discount rate was estimated as a function of health state severity, we found that years lived in better health states are discounted minus years lived in impaired health states. Finally, the best statistical fit was obtained when using a hyperbolic discount function, which resulted in smaller QALY decrements and fewer health states classified as worse than immediate death. Conclusions: Our results highlight the relevance and even necessity of a paradigm shift in health valuation studies in favor of time-preference corrected QALY tariffs, with potentially important implications for health technology assessment calculations and regulatory decisions.",QALY,Health Care Sciences & Services

Validation of the Social Production Function Instrument for the level of well-being short (SPF-ILs),"In a time of aging populations and an enormous increase in frailty within them, examination of these populations' ability to achieve well-being has become increasingly important. This study aims to validate a theory driven instrument for the measurement of well-being in three community-dwelling older populations: (i) a general population, (ii) a frail population, and (iii) Turkish migrants. The short (15-item) version of the Social Production Function Instrument for the Level of Well-being (SPF-ILs) measures whether a person's needs for stimulation, comfort, behavioral confirmation, affection, and status are met. This instrument has been validated only in adult (aged 18-65 years) populations. Three datasets were used to validate the SPF-ILs in samples of the general older population (945 respondents aged >= 70 years), frail older people (414 respondents aged >= 70 years), and older Turkish migrants (680 respondents aged >= 65 years) residing in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Psychometric results showed that the SPF-ILs is a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of well-being and need-related goals to achieve well-being among (frail) native and migrant older populations. Worldwide, countries face the challenge of maintaining community-dwelling older people's well-being. This study clearly showed that older people differ in their realization of well-being which increased our understanding of the ability of community-dwelling older people in various populations to achieve well-being.",Culture,Biomedical Social Sciences

Since the incidence of both was not equal for rich and poor, it is likely to also have affected disparities in health and survival chances by income. We use large nationwide surveys for 2001, 2007 and 2011 to obtain estimates of average income and mortality at the aggregate level of a municipality, and then to examine changes in mortality - and in inequality in mortality by income - over time. Using concentration indices to measure health inequality, we demonstrate that both the mean mortality level and absolute inequality in mortality by income rose rapidly until 2006, and declined again sharply since the rollout of free ART. Relative inequalities in mortality by income, however, remained fairly stable over the 2001-2011 period. The analysis of age-sex-specific mortality rates shows that it was in particular for adults aged 18-59 years that mortality and absolute inequality increased substantially between 2001 and 2006, followed by a rapid drop thereafter. These trends were far more pronounced for males than females. This means that the HIV/AIDS epidemic has taken a serious death toll, which was concentrated disproportionately among the poorest segments of the population and especially affected (older) males. While South Africa has been very successful in curbing the overall mortality trend since 2006, large disparities in survival prospects by income, race and gender continue to exist. Targeted efforts are required if it wants to further reduce the very unequal chances of living to old age for richer and poorer population groups of all ages.",ART,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Data were gathered during Routine Outcome Monitoring. The primary outcome was externalizing problem behavior (Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self Report). Secondary outcomes were the proportion of adolescents living at home, engaged in school or work, and who lacked police contact during treatment. Because of the non-random assignment, a propensity score method was used to control for observed pre-treatment differences. Because the risk-need-responsivity (RNR) model guided treatment assignment, effectiveness was also estimated in youth with and without a court order as an indicator of their risk level. Looking at the whole sample, no difference in effect was found with regard to externalizing problems. For adolescents without a court order, effects on externalizing problems were larger after MST. Because many more adolescents with a court order were assigned to MST compared to FFT, the propensity score method could not balance the treatment groups in this subsample. In conclusion, few differences between MST and FFT were found. In line with the RNR model, higher risk adolescents were assigned to the more intensive treatment, namely MST. In the group with lower risk adolescents, this more intensive treatment was more effective in reducing externalizing problems.",Behavioral problems,Psychology

However, pure cost sharing effects are typically hard to measure due to the presence of adverse selection effects. In this paper, we examine the impact of cost sharing on mental healthcare utilization in the context of mandatory health insurance where adverse selection is absent. Using a large proprietary dataset of a Dutch private health insurer, we examine to what extent a new copayment scheme for adult mental healthcare changed healthcare utilization. We exploit the fact that non-adults are exempted from copayments. First, we compare changes in utilization among adults and non-adults using t tests and a difference-in-difference analysis. Second, we highlight differential changes in mental healthcare utilization by treatment (duration and type of mental illness) and individual characteristics (gender and socioeconomic status). Third, we evaluate to what extent anticipatory behavior occurred pending the introduction and subsequent repeal of the new copayment scheme. Our results show a strong and significant (p < 0.01) decrease in outpatient secondary mental healthcare utilization among adults following the introduction of copayments, which is absent among non-adults.

Rightfully so, as discounting can be quite influential on the outcomes of economic evaluations. The most prominent controversies regarding discounting involve the basis for and height of the discount rate, whether costs and effects should be discounted at the same rate, and whether discount rates should decline or stay constant over time. Moreover, the choice for discount rules depends on the decision context one adopts as the most relevant. In this article, we review these issues and debates, and describe and discuss the current discounting recommendations of the countries publishing their national guidelines.

To date, institutional scholars have either studied professionals or institutions as objects of maintenance or change. Here, we suggest an alternative 'relational' and 'evolutionary' interpretation of the relation between institutions and professionals. We do so by introducing a two-dimensional analytical framework. We illustrate the relevance of this framework by analyzing a policy implementation program called 'Primary Focus'. This program sought to improve the provision of integrated and patient-centered primary care by organizing multidisciplinary collaboration. Progressing through various forms of institutional work, we describe how professionals internalized the principles of 'patient-centeredness' and 'multidisciplinary collaboration' and set out to reach program objectives. We reveal that, while professional identities, roles, and positions were changing in the program, professional boundaries were reproduced. In the process, patient-centeredness turned from a shared objective into a contested professional quality. Consequently, the program did not lead to the new organizational formats that policy-makers had been aiming for. Our two-dimensional approach allows us to explain how this happened and why professionals had literally been working together alone.",institutional layering,Sociology

Methods: We developed a Markov model with a 20-year time horizon to analyze the cost effectiveness using the original study (Trans-European Network-Home-Care Management System) and various data sources. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the decision uncertainty in our model. Results: In the original scenario (which concerned the cost inputs at the time of the original study), HTM and NTS interventions yielded a difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained compared with UC: 2.93 and 3.07, respectively, versus 1.91. An incremental net monetary benefit analysis showed (sic)7,697 and (sic)13,589 in HTM and NTS versus UC at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of (sic)20,000, and (sic)69,100 and (sic)83,100 at a WTP threshold of (sic)80,000, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were (sic)12,479 for HTM versus UC and (sic)8,270 for NTS versus UC. The current scenario (including telenurse cost inputs in NTS) yielded results that were slightly different from those for the original scenario, when comparing all New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes of severity. NTS dominated HTM, compared with UC, in all NYHA classes except NYHA IV. Conclusions: This modeling study demonstrated that HTM and NTS are viable solutions to support patients with chronic heart failure. NTS is cost-effective in comparison with UC at a WTP of (sic)9000/QALY or higher.

We investigated healthcare costs of all Dutch patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma who were treated with ipilimumab. Data were retrieved from the nation-wide Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry. Costs were determined by applying unit costs to individual patient resource use. A total of 807 patients who were diagnosed between July 2012 and July 2015 received ipilimumab in Dutch practice. The mean (median) episode duration was 6.27 (4.61) months (computed from the start of ipilimumab until the start of a next treatment, death, or the last date of follow-up). The average total healthcare costs amounted to Euro81484, but varied widely (range: Euro18131-Euro160002). Ipilimumab was by far the most important cost driver (Euro73739). Other costs were related to hospital admissions (Euro3323), hospital visits (Euro1791), diagnostics and imaging (Euro1505), radiotherapy (Euro828), and surgery (Euro297). Monthly costs for resource use other than ipilimumab were Euro1997 (SD: Euro2629). Treatment-naive patients (n=344) had higher total costs compared with previously-treated patients (n=463; Euro85081 vs. Euro78811). Although patients with colitis (n=106) had higher costs for resource use other than ipilimumab (Euro11426) compared with patients with other types of immune-related adverse events (n=90; Euro9850) and patients with no immune-related adverse event (n=611; Euro6796), they had lower total costs (Euro76075 vs. Euro87882 and Euro81480, respectively). In conclusion, this nation-wide study provides valuable insights into the healthcare costs of advanced cutaneous melanoma patients who were treated with ipilimumab in clinical practice.

We analyzed the existing policies of 15 healthcare organizations and spoke with 35 stakeholders including patients, families, their counselors, the national regulator, and professionals. Respondents argue that involving patients and families is valuable to help deal with the event emotionally, provide additional information, and prevent escalation. Results indicate that involving patients and families is only described in sentinel event policies to a limited extent. In practice, involvement consists mostly of providing aftercare and sharing information about the event by providers. Complexities such as privacy concerns and involuntary admissions are said to hinder involvement. Respondents also emphasize that involvement should not be obligatory and stress the need for patients and families to be involved throughout the process of treatment.

If societies aim to improve health and distribute health(care) fairly, equity-efficiency trade-offs are necessary. In the Netherlands, proportional shortfall (PS) was introduced to quantify necessity of care, allowing a direct equity-efficiency trade-off. This study describes the history and application of PS in the Netherlands and examines the theoretical and empirical support for PS as well as its current role in healthcare decision making. We reviewed the international literature on PS from 2001 onwards, along with publicly accessible meeting reports from the Dutch appraisal committee, Adviescommissie Pakket (ACP), from 2013 to 2016. Our results indicate that there is support for the decision model in which necessity is quantified and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are evaluated against associated monetary reference values. The model enables a uniform framework for priority setting across all healthcare sectors. Although consensus about the application of PS has not yet been reached and alternative ways to quantify necessity were found in ACP reports, PS has increasingly been applied in decision making since 2015. However, empirical support for PS is limited and it may insufficiently reflect societal preferences regarding age and reducing lifetime-health inequalities. Hence, further investigation into refining PS-or exploration of another approach-appears warranted for operationalising the equity-efficiency trade-off. (C) 2018 The Authors.

A simulation study,"Most health insurers in the Netherlands apply community-rating and open enrolment for supplementary health insurance, although it is offered at a free market. Theoretically, this should result in adverse selection. There are four indications that adverse selection indeed has started to occur on the Dutch supplementary insurance market. The goal of this paper is to analyze whether premium differentiation would be able to counteract adverse selection. We do this by simulating the uptake and premium development of supplementary insurance over 25 years using data on healthcare expenses and background characteristics from 110,261 insured. For the simulation of adverse selection, it is assumed that only insured for whom supplementary insurance is expected not to be beneficial will consider opting out of the insurance. Therefore, we calculate for each insured the financial profitability (by making assumptions about the consumer's expected claims and the premium set by the insurer), the individual's risk attitude and the probability to opt out or opt in. The simulation results show that adverse selection might result in a substantial decline in insurance uptake. Additionally, the simulations show that if insurers were to differentiate their premium to 28 age and gender groups, adverse selection could be modestly counteracted. Finally, this paper shows that if insurers would apply highly refined risk-rating, adverse selection for this type of supplementary insurance could be counteracted completely.",Supplementary insurance,Health Care Sciences & Services

Regression analysis showed associations of viewpoints with gender, level of education, religion, voting preferences, and satisfaction with the NHS. The Q2S approach provides a promising means to investigate how in-depth views and opinions are represented in the wider population.

We estimate the effects of the introduction of the Kwara State Health Insurance program in Nigeria on not only the insured but also the uninsured. A subsidized voluntary low cost health insurance was offered by a private insurer as well as a quality upgrade in selected health care facilities. Using propensity score matching and panel data collected in 2009 and 2011 (n = 3509), we find that, for the insured, the program increased health care utilization (36 percent, p < 0.000) and reduced out of pocket expenditure (63 percent, p < 0.000). However, the uninsured in the area with upgraded facilities did not increase their care utilization and even spent less on health care, which is problematic given that 67 percent of the population in the treatment area did not take up the insurance. Our findings suggest that while voluntary health insurance combined with investments in health care supply can increase health care use and financial protection among those that take up the insurance, attention should be paid to potential unintended effects on the typically sizeable group of people who do not enroll in the insurance.",Nigeria,Biomedical Social Sciences

Objective: To develop for the first time a catalog of primary impediments to RD research and HTA, and to describe the cause and effect of individual challenges. Methods: Challenges were identified by an international 22-person expert working group and qualitative outreach to colleagues with relevant expertise. A broad range of stakeholder perspectives is represented. Draft results were presented at annual European and North American International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) congresses, and written comments were received by the 385-strong ISPOR Rare Disease Review Group from two rounds of review. Findings were refined and confirmed via targeted literature search. Results: Research-related challenges linked to the low prevalence of RDs were categorized into those pertaining to disease recognition and diagnosis, evaluation of treatment effect, and patient recruitment for clinical research. HTA-related challenges were classified into issues relating to the lack of a tailored HTA method for RD treatments and uncertainty for HTA agencies and health care payers. Conclusions: Identifying and highlighting diverse, but interrelated, key challenges in RD research and HTA is an essential first step toward developing implementable and sustainable solutions.

For quantitative evaluation, a sample of 945 independently living older adults residing in four districts of Rotterdam were asked to complete a questionnaire in 2013 (response rate = 62%; N = 558). In addition, 32 interviews were conducted with frail and non-frail older people. Results showed that gender, age and especially frailty were related to missed neighbourhood characteristics. People displayed awareness of their increasing frailty and often acknowledged that it increased the need for neighbourhood characteristics enabling them to age in place. We can conclude that dependence on neighbourhoods varies with frailty status. This relationship is dynamic; with frailty, older people become more dependent on their neighbourhood. However, expectations regarding neighbourhood characteristics seem to dissipate with advanced age and increasing frailty.",physical environment,Geriatrics & Gerontology

We applied the direct method, which measures discounting independent of utility, in a representative French sample, interviewed at home by professional interviewers. We found more discounting for money than for health. The median discount rates (6.5% for money and 2.2% for health) were close to market interest rates, suggesting that at the aggregate level the direct method solves the puzzle of unrealistically high discount rates typically observed in applied economics. Constant discounting fitted the data better than the hyperbolic discounting models that we considered. The substantial individual heterogeneity in discounting was correlated with age and occupation.",Hyperbolic discounting,Business & Economics

We use a recently proposed alternative approach to value willingness to pay (WTP) for health, making use of trade-offs between income and life years or quality of life, which we extend to allow for a more realistic multiplicative utility function over health and money. Moreover, we show how reference-dependency can be incorporated into this model and derive its predictions for WTP elicitation. We propose three experimental elicitation procedures and test these in a feasibility study, analysing the responses under different assumptions about the discount rate. Several interesting results are reported: first, the data are highly skewed, but if we trim the 5% lowest and highest values, we obtain plausible WTP estimates. Second, the results differ considerably between procedures, indicating that WTP estimates are sensitive to the assumed utility function. Third, respondents appear to be loss averse for both health and money, which is consistent with assumptions from prospect theory. Finally, our results also indicate that respondents are more willing to trade quality of life than life years.",Willingness to pay,Health Care Sciences & Services

This study aimed to investigate the level of work participation among PLWH in the Netherlands, and the associated determinants of employment. Methods For this study the baseline measurements of a longitudinal cohort study with a 2-year follow-up, the TREVI project, were used. The TREVI project aims to study cognitive function disorders among PLWH in relation to their employment, productivity, and social functioning. From December 2012 until December 2013, data on cognitive functioning, measured by the HIV Dementia Scale, and medical data derived from patient records were collected. Employment status and possible determinants of employment were assessed by a digital survey. Chi square analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted in order to investigate the level of employment and associated determinants of employment. Results This cross-sectional study revealed significant differences in the level of employment compared with Dutch reference data: i.e. in the age group 40-54 years PLWH had a significantly lower employment rate than the general Dutch population. Multivariate analysis showed that employment was negatively associated with a lower or higher age (reference: 40-54 years), a longer period since diagnosis, problems with physical functioning, and a higher score on the HADS Depression. Having paid work at diagnosis was positively associated with employment. Conclusion PLWH, particularly in the age of 40-54, in the Netherlands have a significant lower level of employment compared to the general population. Counseling should address reduced psychological and physical functioning in order to improve the position of PLWH on the labor market.",Vocational guidance,Social Issues

For the Austrian T-Mobile/tele.ring merger, we conclude that after the acquisition (for which remedies were imposed) prices in Austria did not increase relative to the considered control countries. For the Dutch T-Mobile/Orange merger, we observe an increase in the mobile tariff prices in the Netherlands in the analysed period, relative to the control countries. We cannot firmly establish whether this price increase was exclusively caused by the T-Mobile/Orange merger or in part by possible price effects brought about by the KPN/Telfort merger consummated two years earlier in the Netherlands. However, we believe that such price increase could be linked to the structural changes brought by both KPN/Telfort and T-Mobile/Orange mergers together.",Telecommunications,Business & Economics

The aim of this study was therefore to examine how an integrated care intervention for community-dwelling frail elderly people affects the amount and type of formal and informal care over 12months as compared to usual care. A quasi-experimental design with a control group was used. Data regarding formal and informal care were collected from frail elderly patients (n=207) and informal caregivers (n=74) with pre/post-questionnaires. Within- and between-group comparisons and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. The results showed marginal changes over time in the amount of formal and informal care in both integrated care and usual care. However, different associations between changes in formal and informal care were found in integrated and usual care. Most notably, informal caregivers provided more instrumental assistance over time if formal caregivers provided less personal care (and vice versa) in integrated care but not in usual care. These results suggest that integrated care does not necessarily change the contribution of formal or informal care, but changes the interaction between formal (personal care) and informal (instrumental) activities.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR) and Erasmus University Rotterdam were commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this submission. The ERG reviewed the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model, and conducted exploratory analyses in order to assess the robustness and validity of the presented clinical and cost-effectiveness results. This paper describes the company submission, the ERG assessment, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The company conducted a systematic review to identify studies comparing POM with comparators outlined in the NICE scope: panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone (PANO + BOR + DEX), bendamustine with thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD) and conventional chemotherapy (CC). The main clinical effectiveness evidence was obtained from MM-003, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing POM + LoDEX with high-dose dexamethasone (HiDEX; used as a proxy for CC). Additional data from other studies were also used as nonrandomized observational data sources for the indirect treatment comparison of POM + LoDEX with BTD and PANO + BOR + DEX. Covariate or treatment switching adjustment methods were used for each comparison. The model developed in Microsoft((R)) Excel 2010 using a semi-Markov partitioned survival structure, submitted in the original submission to NICE for TA338, was adapted for the present assessment of the cost effectiveness of POM + LoDEX. Updated evidence from the clinical-effectiveness part was used for the survival modelling of progression-free survival and overall survival. For POM + LoDEX, the patient access scheme (PAS) discount was applied to the POM price. Three separate comparisons were conducted for each comparator, each comparison using a different dataset and adjustment methods. The ERG identified and corrected some errors, and the corrected incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for POM + LoDEX versus each comparator were presented: approximately 45,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus BTD, savings of approximately 143,000 pound per QALY lost versus PANO + BOR + DEX, and approximately 49,000 pound per QALY gained versus CC. The ERG also conducted full incremental analyses, which revealed that CC, POM + LoDEX and PANO + BOR + DEX were on the cost-effectiveness frontier. The committee's decision on the technology under analysis deemed that POM + LoDEX should be recommended as an option for treating multiple myeloma in adults at third or subsequent relapse of treatments including both LEN and BOR, contingent on the company providing POM with the discount agreed in the PAS.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Due to the sophistication of this RE-model and the complexity of the associations in the dataset (N=similar to 16.7 million), there are theoretically more than a million interaction terms. We used regression tree modelling, which has been applied rarely within the field of RE, to identify interaction terms that statistically significantly explain variation in observed expenses that is not already explained by the risk adjusters in this RE-model. The interaction terms identified were used as additional risk adjusters in the RE-model. We found evidence that interaction terms can improve the prediction of expenses overall and for specific groups in the population. However, the prediction of expenses for some other selective groups may deteriorate. Thus, interactions can reduce financial incentives for risk selection for some groups but may increase them for others. Furthermore, because regression trees are not robust, additional criteria are needed to decide which interaction terms should be used in practice. These criteria could be the right incentive structure for risk selection and efficiency or the opinion of medical experts.",risk equalization,Health Care Sciences & Services

Methods: A payer-perspective cost-effectiveness model simulated disease progression in patients with RA who had previously failed conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and were starting biologic therapy. Patients commenced treatment with abatacept or adalimumab plus methotrexate and were evaluated after 6 months. Therapy continuation was based on the European League Against Rheumatism treatment response; disease progression was based on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score. These score changes were used to estimate health state utilities and direct medical costs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY gained were calculated by baseline ACPA groups (Q1, 28-234 AU/ml; Q2, 235-609 AU/ml; Q3, 613-1045 AU/ml; and Q4, 1060-4894 AU/ml). Scenario analysis and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate robustness of model assumptions. Results: Abatacept resulted in QALY gain versus adalimumab in ACPA Q1, Q3, and Q4; between-treatment difference (difference: Q1, -0.115 Q2, -0.009 Q3, 0.045; and Q4, 0.279). Total lifetime discounted cost was higher for abatacept versus adalimumab in most quartiles (Q2, 77,612 pound vs. 77,546; pound Q3, 74,441 pound vs. 73,263; pound and Q4, 78,428 pound vs. 76,696) pound because of longer time on treatment. Incremental cost per QALY for abatacept (vs. adalimumab) was the lowest in the high ACPA titer group (Q4, 6200 pound/QALY), followed by the next lowest titer group (Q3, 26,272 pound/QALY). Conclusions: Abatacept is a cost effective alternative to adalimumab in patients with RA with high ACPA levels.",treatment costs,Health Care Sciences & Services

Treatment-related toxicity was also comparable with only hepatotoxicity seen more frequently in the CODOX/M-IVAC group (p = 0.004). Costs were determined by the number of rituximab gifts and the number of inpatients days. Overall, CODOX-M/IVAC had the most beneficial profile with regards to costs, treatment duration, and percentage of patients completing planned treatment. We conclude that the four treatment protocols for Burkitt lymphoma yield nearly identical results with regards to efficacy and safety but differ in treatment duration and costs. These differences may help guide future choice of treatment.",Cost nalysis,Hematology

Although it may appear evident that occupation can affect health, there are multiple possible sources of selection that can generate a strong association, other than simply a causal effect of occupation on health. We link job characteristics to German panel data spanning 29years to characterize occupations by their physical and psychosocial burden. Employing a dynamic model to control for factors that simultaneously affect health and selection into occupation, we find that selection into occupation accounts for at least 60% of the association. The effects of occupational characteristics such as physical strain and low job control are negative and increase with age: late-career exposure to 1year of high physical strain and low job control is comparable to the average health decline from ageing 16 and 6months, respectively.",occupational stressors,Health Care Sciences & Services

For an important part, the complexity stems from the stochastic nature of the problem. In practice, this stochastic nature often leads to schedule adaptations on the day of schedule execution. While operating room performance is thus importantly affected by such adaptations, decision-making on adaptations is hardly addressed in scientific literature. Building on previous literature on adaptive scheduling, we develop adaptive operating room scheduling models and problems, and analyse the performance of corresponding adaptive scheduling policies. As previously proposed (fully) adaptive scheduling models and policies are infeasible in operating room scheduling practice, we extend adaptive scheduling theory by introducing the novel concept of committing. Moreover, the core of the proposed adaptive policies with committing is formed by a new, exact, pseudo-polynomial algorithm to solve a general class of stochastic knapsack problems. Using these theoretical advances, we present performance analysis on practical problems, using data from existing literature as well as real-life data from the largest academic medical centre in The Netherlands. The analysis shows that the practically feasible, basic, 1-level policy already brings substantial and statistically significant improvement over static policies. Moreover, as a rule of thumb, scheduling surgeries with large mean duration or standard deviation early appears good practice.",operations research in healthcare,Operations Research & Management Science

Information regarding the type and frequency of stroke imaging was analysed. Computed Tomography (CT) was reported as the main diagnostic imaging modality used in stroke care (78-98% across patient profiles and time periods). This review revealed patterns that were not observed in individual studies. Comparisons of UK studies revealed considerable variations in the proportion of scanned patients and timing of imaging.Expert commentary: While the evidence about thrombectomy is difficult to translate in clinical practice, the evidence regarding the optimal imaging approach to diagnose stroke patients is lacking.

We investigate whether productivity at work differs between these groups.The questionnaires used in these studies contained a core of identical questions regarding productivity losses, in the form of absenteeism and presenteeism, over a four-week period and a variety of baseline characteristics, including health status measured with EQ-5D. For PLWH additional clinical data were collected from patient records. From the data, descriptive statistics were computed to characterize the samples. Pearson correlations were used to explore significant associations of productivity with baseline characteristics. A two-part model was used to evaluate both the occurrence and of size of productivity losses in working PLWH and an aggregated sample of PLWH and the general population.It was observed that, on average, total productivity losses do not differ significantly between working PWLH and the general working population, but that the occurrence and size of absenteeism and presenteeism were different. Furthermore, more health problems were associated with higher productivity losses. HIV status was not significantly associated with productivity losses.We conclude that among working people, health status was related to productivity losses but HIV status was not.

The aims of this study were to record which categories of pests were reported in homes and to use a social cognition model, the health belief model, to investigate which psychological factors influence householders' intentions to control pests. An online questionnaire was completed by 413 respondents between 11 September and 31 November 2015. A large majority of respondents reported pests in or around their home within the previous year. The prevalences were: flying insects 98%, crawling insects 85%, rodents 62%, birds 58%, and moles 20%. Regression analysis for the health belief model revealed that perceiving greater benefits and fewer barriers to pest control and expecting severe consequences of zoonotic infections predicted higher intention to control pests. Intentions towards pest control were not influenced by perceiving oneself as susceptible to catching a disease from pests or health motivation (striving towards a healthy lifestyle). Intentions to engage in pest control were lower for households reporting bird prevalence. The findings suggest that interventions aimed at improving the effectiveness of domestic pest control should focus on increasing the benefits that individuals associate with effective pest control, lowering barriers, and on underlining the severity of the diseases that pests may carry.",,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Various HTA tools and metrics have been developed and refined over the years, including systematic literature reviews (Cochrane), economic modelling, and cost-effectiveness ratios and acceptability curves. However, while the cost-effectiveness ratio is faithfully reported in most full economic evaluations, it is viewed by many as an insufficient basis for reimbursement decisions. Emotional debates about the reimbursement of cancer drugs, orphan drugs, and end-of-life treatments have revealed fundamental disagreements about what should and should not be considered in reimbursement decisions. Part of this disagreement seems related to the equity-efficiency tradeoff, which reflects fundamental differences in priorities. All in all, it is clear that countries aiming to improve UHC policies will have to go beyond the capacity building needed to utilize the available HTA toolbox. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) offers a more comprehensive tool for reimbursement decisions where different weights of different factors/attributes can give policymakers important insights to consider. Sooner or later, every country will have to develop their own way to carefully combine the results of those tools with their own priorities.

A natural approach to reducing the under- or overcompensation for a particular group is enriching the risk equalization model with risk adjustor variables that indicate membership in that group. For some groups, however, appropriate risk adjustor variables may not (yet) be available. For these situations, this paper proposes an alternative approach to reducing under- or overcompensation: constraining the estimated coefficients of the risk equalization model such that the under- or overcompensation for a group of interest equals a fixed amount. We show that, compared to ordinary least-squares, constrained regressions can reduce under/overcompensation for some groups but increase under/overcompensation for others. In order to quantify this trade-off two fundamental questions need to be answered: ""Which groups are relevant in terms of risk selection actions?"" and ""What is the relative importance of under- and overcompensation for these groups?"" By making assumptions on these aspects we empirically evaluate a particular set of constraints using individual-level data from the Netherlands (N = 16.5 million). We find that the benefits of introducing constraints in terms of reduced under/overcompensations for some groups can be worth the costs in terms of increased under/overcompensations for others. Constrained regressions add a tool for developing risk equalization models that can improve the overall economic performance of health plan payment schemes.",Constrained regression,Health Care Sciences & Services

There are positive effects on receipt of ambulatory care and medication that are largest among the elderly and the poorest. The probability of getting formal health care when sick is increased by almost two fifths, but the likelihood of being unable to afford treatment is reduced by more than a quarter. Consistent with the shallow coverage offered, there is no impact on use of inpatient care. Neither is there any effect on average out-of-pocket health care expenditure, but medical spending is reduced by up to 25% in the top quarter of the distribution.

A Test of Health State Reference Dependency Using Self-assessed Health and an Efficient Discrete Choice Experiment,"Health state valuations of patients and non-patients are not the same, whereas health state values obtained from general population samples are a weighted average of both. The latter constitutes an often-overlooked source of bias. This study investigates the resulting bias and tests for the impact of reference dependency on health state valuations using an efficient discrete choice experiment administered to a Dutch nationally representative sample of 788 respondents. A Bayesian discrete choice experiment design consisting of eight sets of 24 (matched pairwise) choice tasks was developed, with each set providing full identification of the included parameters. Mixed logit models were used to estimate health state preferences with respondents' own health included as an additional predictor. Our results indicate that respondents with impaired health worse than or equal to the health state levels under evaluation have approximately 30% smaller health state decrements. This confirms that reference dependency can be observed in general population samples and affirms the relevance of prospect theory in health state valuations. At the same time, the limited number of respondents with severe health impairments does not appear to bias social tariffs as obtained from general population samples.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's submission, the ERG review, and NICE's subsequent decisions. Clinical effectiveness evidence for ramucirumab monotherapy (RAM), compared with best supportive care (BSC), was based on data from the REGARD trial. Clinical effectiveness evidence for ramucirumab combination therapy (RAM + PAC), compared with paclitaxel monotherapy (PAC), was based on data from the RAINBOW trial. In addition, the company undertook a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare RAM + PAC with BSC and docetaxel. Cost-effectiveness evidence of monotherapy and combination therapy relied on partitioned survival, cost-utility models. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the company was A 188,640 pound (vs BSC) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for monotherapy and A 118,209 pound (vs BSC) per QALY gained for combination therapy. The ERG assessment indicated that the modelling structure represented the course of the disease; however, a few errors were identified and some of the input parameters were challenged. The ERG provided a new base case, with ICERs (vs BSC) of A 188,100 pound (monotherapy) per QALY gained and A 129,400 pound (combination therapy) per QALY gained and conducted additional exploratory analyses. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC), considered the company's decision problem was in line with the NICE scope, with the exception of the choice of comparators for the combination therapy model. The most plausible ICER for ramucirumab monotherapy compared with BSC was A 188,100 pound per QALY gained. The Committee considered that the ERG's exploratory analysis in which RAM + PAC was compared with PAC by using the direct head-to-head data (including utilities) from the RAINBOW trial, provided the most plausible ICER (i.e. A 408,200 pound per QALY gained) for ramucirumab combination therapy. The Committee concluded that end-of-life considerations cannot be applied for either case, since neither failed to offer an extension to life of at least 3 months. The company did not submit a patient access scheme (PAS). After consideration of the evidence, the Committee concluded that ramucirumab alone or with paclitaxel could not be considered a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources for treating advanced GC/GOJ patients that were previously treated with chemotherapy, and therefore its use could not be recommended. We might wonder if a complete STA process is necessary for treatments without a PAS, which are, according to the company's submission, already associated with ICERs far above the currently accepted threshold in all (base-case, sensitivity and scenario) analyses.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

On the demand side, adverse selection leads to plan price distortions resulting in inefficient sorting of consumers across health plans. On the supply side, adverse selection creates incentives for plans to inefficiently distort benefits to attract profitable enrollees. Reinsurance, risk adjustment, and premium categories address these problems. Building on prior research on health plan payment system evaluation, we develop measures of the efficiency consequences of price and benefit distortions under a given payment system. Our measures are based on explicit economic models of insurer behavior under adverse selection, incorporate multiple features of plan payment systems, and can be calculated prior to observing actual insurer and consumer behavior. We illustrate the use of these measures with data from a simulated market for individual health insurance. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Risk adjustment,Health Care Sciences & Services

Alternative approaches, such as the latent class analysis (LCA), may add to the further understanding of variations in TTO responses. OBJECTIVES: To identify whether subgroups of respondents can be identified on the basis of their responses to TTO exercises and to investigate which respondent characteristics are associated with membership of the identified subgroups. METHODS: Members of the Dutch general public, aged 18 to 65 years, completed a Web-based questionnaire concerning sociodemographic characteristics, three TTO exercises valuing health states described using the domains of the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, and preference for quality versus quantity of life. LCA was used to identify patterns in the responses. Predictive variables were included in the final LCA model to identify the particular respondent characteristics that predict subgroup membership. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 1067 respondents. Four latent classes were identified in the responses to TTO exercises. Two were high traders, focusing on quality of life and trading off a relatively high number of years. The other two were low traders, focusing on length of life. Predictive analyses revealed significant differences between subgroups in terms of age, sex, subjective life expectancy, and preference for quantity over quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that distinct classes of respondents can be discerned in TTO responses from the general public, distinguishing subgroups of low and high traders. More research in this area should confirm our findings and investigate their implications for health state valuation exercises.

Policymakers are faced with choices on the implementation of a specific cost sharing design. One of the guiding principles in this decision process could be which design leads to the strongest CCI. Despite the vast amount of literature on the effects of cost sharing, the relative effects of specific cost sharing designs-e.g., a traditional deductible versus a doughnut hole-will mostly be absent for a certain context. This papers aims at developing a simulation model to approximate the relative effects of different deductible modalities on the CCI. We argue that the CCI depends on the probability that healthcare expenses end up in the deductible range and the expected healthcare expenses given that they end up in the deductible range. Our empirical application shows that different deductible modalities result in different CCIs and that the CCI under a certain modality differs across risk-groups.",Incentives,Health Care Sciences & Services

The period is characterized by a major health insurance reform in 2006 to provide health insurers with more incentives and tools to compete, and to provide consumers with a more differentiated choice of products. Prior to the reform, in the period 1995-2005, we find a low number of switchers, between 2 and 4% a year, modest average total switching gains of 2 million euros per year and short-term health plan price elasticities ranging from -0.1 to -0.4. The major reform in 2006 resulted in an all-time high switching rate of 18%, total switching gains of 130 million euros, and a high short-term price elasticity of -5.7. During 2007-2015 switching rates returned to lower levels, between 4 and 8% per year, with total switching gains in the order of 40 million euros per year on average. Total switching gains could have been 10 times higher if all consumers had switched to one of the cheapest plans. We find short-term price elasticities ranging between -0.9 and -2.2. Our estimations suggest substantial consumer inertia throughout the entire period, as we find degrees of choice persistence ranging from about 0.8 to 0.9.",Switching gains,Health Care Sciences & Services

However, conceptual clarity is lacking in the literature and in practice. Therefore, a systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted to reveal the different conceptualizations of medical leadership in terms of definitions, roles and activities, and personal-and context-specific features. Eight databases were systematically searched for eligible studies, including empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals that included physicians carrying out a manager or leadership role in a hospital setting. Finally, 34 articles were included and their findings were synthesized and analyzed narratively. Medical leadership is conceptualized in literature either as physicians with formal managerial roles or physicians who act as informal 'leaders' in daily practices. In both forms, medical leaders must carry out general management and leadership activities and acts to balance between management and medicine, because these physicians must accomplish both organizational and medical staff objectives. To perform effectively, credibility among medical peers appeared to be the most important factor, followed by a scattered list of fields of knowledge, skills and attitudes. Competing logics, role ambiguity and a lack of time and support were perceived as barriers. However, the extent to which physicians must master all elicited features, remains ambiguous. Furthermore, the extent to which medical leadership entails a shift or a reallocation of tasks that are at the core of medical professional work remains unclear. Future studies should implement stronger research designs in which more theory is used to study the effect of medical leadership on professional work, medical staff governance, and subsequently, the quality and efficiency of care.",,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Although statistical testing seems applicable, guidelines for the validation of HE models lack guidance on statistical validation, and actual validation efforts often present subjective judgment of graphs and point estimates. Objectives: To discuss the applicability of existing validation techniques and to present a new method for quantifying the degrees of validity statistically, which is useful for decision makers. Methods: A new Bayesian method is proposed to determine how well HE model outcomes compare with empirical data. Validity is based on a preestablished accuracy interval in which the model outcomes should fall. The method uses the outcomes of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and results in a posterior distribution around the probability that HE model outcomes can be regarded as valid. Results: We use a published diabetes model (Modelling Integrated Care for Diabetes based on Observational data) to validate the outcome ""number of patients who are on dialysis or with end-stage renal disease."" Results indicate that a high probability of a valid outcome is associated with relatively wide accuracy intervals. In particular, 25% deviation from the observed outcome implied approximately 60% expected validity. Conclusions: Current practice in HE model validation can be improved by using an alternative method based on assessing whether the model outcomes fit to empirical data at a predefined level of accuracy. This method has the advantage of assessing both model bias and parameter uncertainty and resulting in a quantitative measure of the degree of validity that penalizes models predicting the mean of an outcome correctly but with overly wide credible intervals.",validation,Health Care Sciences & Services

The newly introduced financial instrument of ""care-intensity packages"" in the Dutch long-term care sector fit this development since they have some characteristics of a market device. However, policy makers and care providers positioned these instruments as explicitly not belonging to the general trend of marketisation in healthcare. Using a qualitative case study approach, we study the work that the two providers have done to fit these instruments to their organisations and how that enables and legitimatises market development. Both providers have done various types of work that could be classified as market development, including creating accounting systems suitable for markets, redefining public values in the context of markets, and starting commercial initiatives. Paradoxically, denying the existence of markets for long-term care and thus avoiding ideological debates on the marketisation of healthcare has made the use of market devices all the more likely. Making the market invisible seems to be an operative element in making the market work. Our findings suggest that Dutch long-term care reform points to the need to study the 'making' rather than the 'liberalising' of markets and that the study of healthcare markets should not be confined to those practices that explicitly label themselves as such.",The Netherlands,Biomedical Social Sciences

The aim of the study was to develop a decision tool that aids clinicians in early identification of these patients. After identification of criteria that were indicative of severity and complexity of eating disorder psychopathology by means of a systematic review of literature and consultation of a focus group, a Delphi method was applied to obtain consensus from experts on the list of relevant criteria. Finally, the decision tool was validated in clinical practice, and cut-off criteria were established.

We estimate the impact of providing informal care to one's partner on the caregiver's health using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe. We use statistical matching to deal with selection bias and endogeneity. We find that in the short run caregiving has a substantial effect on the health of caregivers and, for female caregivers, on their health care use. These effects should be taken into account when comparing the costs and benefits of formal and informal care provision. The health effects may, however, be short-lived, as we do not find any evidence that they persist after 4 or 7years.",SHARE,Health Care Sciences & Services

As of 2004, in an attempt to improve the utilization and performance of these public primary healthcare facilities, the government has gradually started contracting-in intergovernmental organizations to manage these BHUs. Using five nationally representative household surveys conducted between 2001 and 2012, and exploiting the gradual roll-out of this reform to apply a difference-in-difference approach, we evaluate its impact on BHU utilization. We find that contracting of the BHU management did not have any effect on health care use generally in the population, but it did significantly increase the use of BHU for childhood diarrhoea for the poor (by 4% points) and rural (3% points) households. These increases were accompanied by lower rates of self-treatment and private facilities usage. We do not find any significant effects on the self-reported satisfaction with BHU utilization. Our findings contrast with earlier small-scale studies that reported larger effects of the contracting of primary care in Pakistan. We speculate that the modest additional budget, the limited management authority of the contracting agency and the lack of clear performance indicators are reasons for the small impact of the contracting reform. Apparently critical aspects of services delivery such as location of BHUs, ineffective referral system and medical practice variation in public and private sectors have contributed to the overall low utilization of BHUs, yet these were beyond the scope of the contracting reform.",difference-in-difference,Health Care Sciences & Services

Results show the state of NSCLC survival and care in the Netherlands. Methods: The Netherlands Cancer Registry provided data on NSCLC survival for all Dutch hospitals. We used the Kaplan-Meier estimate to calculate median survival time by hospital type and a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the relative risk of mortality (expressed as hazard ratios) for patients diagnosed in academic versus non-academic hospitals, with adjustment for age, gender, and tumor histology, and stratifying for disease stage. Data on treatment patterns in Dutch hospitals was obtained from 4 hospitals (2 academic, 2 non-academic). A random sample of patients diagnosed with NSCLC from January 2009 until January 2011 was identified through hospital databases. Data was obtained on patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, and treatments. Results: The Cox proportional hazards model shows a significantly decreased hazard ratio of mortality for patients diagnosed in academic hospitals, as opposed to patients diagnosed in non-academic hospitals. This is specifically true for primary radiotherapy patients and patients who receive systemic treatment for non-metastasized NSCLC. Conclusion: Patients diagnosed in academic hospitals have better median overall survival than patients diagnosed in non-academic hospitals, especially for patients treated with radiotherapy, systemic treatment, or combinations. This difference may be caused by residual confounding since the estimates were not adjusted for performance status. A wide variety of surgical, radiotherapeutic, and systemic treatments is prescribed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Therapy,Oncology

Several diagnostic tests, such as myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), are accurate for the detection of CAD, as well as having prognostic value for the prediction of cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, the diagnostic and prognostic value of these tests should be cost-effective and should lead to improved clinical outcome. We have reviewed the literature on the cost-effectiveness of MPS in different circumstances: (i) the diagnosis and management of CAD; (ii) comparison with exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and other imaging tests; (iii) as gatekeeper to invasive coronary angiography (ICA), (iv) the impact of appropriate use criteria; (v) acute chest pain, and (vi) screening of asymptomatic patients with type-2 diabetes.

The results also suggest that a more detailed scale with a more realistic range may help respondents to elicit values closer to their ""true"" WTP values, hence produce higher-quality outcomes.

Because services for older people often aim to improve multiple life aspects, valid measures are needed to examine their benefits on individuals' health and well-being simultaneously. Two measures may meet this end: the Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit (ASCOT) and the ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people (ICECAP-O). Objectives: To compare the validity of both measures, the ASCOT and the ICECAP-O. Methods: A sampling agency gathered cross-sectional data in May 2015. Using exploratory factor analysis, the underlying factor structure of the ASCOT and the ICECAP-O was examined for the first time. Convergent and discriminant validity in relation to health measures (five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale, Barthel Index, and Geriatric Depression Scale-15) and well-being measures (Older People's Quality of Life Questionnaire-13, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Cantril's Ladder) were tested using Spearman rank correlations and variance analysis. Results: The ASCOT and the ICECAP-O tapped into a shared factor, whereas both measures also loaded on two separate factors. The ASCOT and the ICECAP-O correlated highly with the health and well-being measures, but the correlation with the physical health measure Barthel Index was moderate. Both measures discriminated between subgroups of respondents. Conclusions: The ASCOT and the ICECAP-O seem promising measures to evaluate well-being among older people, whereby the ASCOT seems more specific to social care-related outcomes. The performance of both measures in other respondent groups and countries, and their relation to physical health, need to be further examined before their use in economic evaluations can be recommended.",well-being,Health Care Sciences & Services

We compared older adults, aged 65-89, who were admitted to a long-term care (LTC) institution in the period 1996-1999 and 2006-2009. Using the Andersen model, we tested per block of predisposing, enabling and need factors, which factors were significant predictors of admission to institutional care. With a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition regression, we decomposed the difference in admission to an LTC institution between the period 1996-1999 and 2006-2009 into a part that is due to differences in health needs and other factors such as effect of policy, social values, and technology. Between 1996 and 2006, the percentage of co-residing partners and income increased and the average level of loneliness decreased significantly. The prevalence of disability, chronic diseases, however, increased. Whereas the care by partners declined, the formal care by professionals increased. Although the observed decline in the admission rate to institutional care was relatively small across the 10 years (from 5.3 % in 1996-1999 to 4.5 % in 2006-2009, a 15 % decrease), the probability of admission in 2006-2009 was relatively much lower when accounting for changes in the health and social conditions of the participants: the probability was 1.7-2.1 % point lower for adults in the period 2006-2009 compared to 1996-1999, a 32-40 % decrease. Our results show that the decline in the admission rate to LTC institutions is not the result of changes in need. The decline is suggested to be the combined effect of changes in policy, technological advances and changes in social norms.",Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition,Geriatrics & Gerontology

Generally, it is observed that, with advancing age, health deteriorates and healthcare expenditures increase. This seems to imply that increases in life expectancy would strongly increase both the demand for healthcare expenditures and the number of years lived in poor health. Previous research has shown that such straightforward conclusions may be flawed. For example, it has been established that not age but 'time to death' is the main driver of increased healthcare expenditures at advanced ages. The paper extends this line of research by investigating the relationship between age, time to death and health, the last being longitudinally measured via a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire. We propose an approach for modelling the health-related quality-of-life outcome that accounts for both the non-standard nature of this response variable (e.g. bounded, left skewed or heteroscedastic) and the panel structure of the data.

If interventions are targeted at multiple diseases and/or risk factors, these mortality rates need to be combined in a single model. This requires them to be mutually adjusted to avoid 'double counting' of mortality. We present a mathematical modeling approach to describe the joint effect of mutually dependent risk factors and chronic diseases on mortality in a consistent manner. Most importantly, this approach explicitly allows the use of readily available external data sources. An additional advantage is that existing models can be smoothly expanded to encompass more diseases/risk factors. To illustrate the usefulness of this method and how it should be implemented, we present a health economic model that links risk factors for diseases to mortality from these diseases, and describe the causal chain running from these risk factors (e.g., obesity) through to the occurrence of disease (e.g., diabetes, CVD) and death. Our results suggest that these adjustment procedures may have a large impact on estimated mortality rates. An improper adjustment of the mortality rates could result in an underestimation of disease prevalence and, therefore, disease costs.",multimorbidity,Medical Informatics

One criterion for priority setting may be the 'acceptable health' approach, which suggests that society may want to assign higher priority to health benefits in people with ""unacceptable"" than in people with ""acceptable"" health. A level of acceptable health then serves as a reference point for priority setting. Empirical research has indicated that people may be able and willing to define health states as ""unacceptable"" or ""acceptable"", but little attention has been given to the normative implications of evaluating health benefits in relation to a reference level of acceptable health. The current paper aims to address this gap by relating insights from the distributive justice literature, i.e. the sufficientarian literature, to the acceptable health approach, as we argue that these approaches are related. We specifically focus on the implications of an 'acceptability' approach for priority weighting of health benefits, derived from sufficientarian reasoning and debates, and assess the moral implications of such weighting.

To develop and validate a new conceptual model (CM) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for use in disease progression and economic modeling. The CM identifies and describes qualitative associations between disease attributes, progression and outcomes. Methods. A literature review was performed to identify any published CMs or literature reporting the impact and association of COPD disease attributes with outcomes. After critical analysis of the literature, a Steering Group of experts from the disciplines of health economics, epidemiology and clinical medicine was convened to develop a draft CM, which was refined using a Delphi process. The refined CM was validated by testing for associations between attributes using data from the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE). Results. Disease progression attributes included in the final CM were history and occurrence of exacerbations, lung function, exercise capacity, signs and symptoms (cough, sputum, dyspnea), cardiovascular disease comorbidities, 'other' comorbidities (including depression), body composition (body mass index), fibrinogen as a biomarker, smoking and demographic characteristics (age, gender). Mortality and health-related quality of life were determined to be the most relevant final outcome measures for this model, intended to be the foundation of an economic model of COPD. Conclusion. The CM is being used as the foundation for developing a new COPD model of disease progression and to provide a framework for the analysis of patient-level data. The CM is available as a reference for the implementation of further disease progression and economic models.",economic modeling,Medical Informatics

The recent joint International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research / Society for Medical Decision Making Modeling Good Research Practices Task Force emphasized the importance of conceptualizing and validating models. We report a new model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (part of the Galaxy project) founded on a conceptual model, implemented using a novel linked-equation approach, and internally validated. Methods. An expert panel developed a conceptual model including causal relationships between disease attributes, progression, and final outcomes. Risk equations describing these relationships were estimated using data from the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) study, with costs estimated from the TOwards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study. Implementation as a linked-equation model enabled direct estimation of health service costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for COPD patients over their lifetimes. Internal validation compared 3 years of predicted cohort experience with ECLIPSE results. Results. At 3 years, the Galaxy COPD model predictions of annual exacerbation rate and annual decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second fell within the ECLIPSE data confidence limits, although 3year overall survival was outside the observed confidence limits. Projections of the risk equations over time permitted extrapolation to patient lifetimes. Averaging the predicted cost/QALY outcomes for the different patients within the ECLIPSE cohort gives an estimated lifetime cost of 25,214 pound (undiscounted)/20,318 pound (discounted) and lifetime QALYs of 6.45 (undiscounted/5.24 [discounted]) per ECLIPSE patient. Conclusions. A new form of model for COPD was conceptualized, implemented, and internally validated, based on a series of linked equations using epidemiological data (ECLIPSE) and cost data (TORCH). This Galaxy model predicts COPD outcomes from treatment effects on disease attributes such as lung function, exacerbations, symptoms, or exercise capacity; further external validation is required.",model,Medical Informatics

Willingness of Iranian policy makers to control the population's growth rate resulted in the provision of countrywide family planning services and contraceptives from 1990 to 2013. Now policy makers favour population growth because of a statistically significant decline in the fertility rate and ageing of the population. New population policies contain incentives for higher fertility and limitations on family planning services. Some elements of these policies contradict standards of international human rights treaties including prohibition against retrogressive measures and limitations on sexual and reproductive health services. These policies may jeopardize individual and public health. Iran should immediately revoke these laws and policies and progressively improve people's enjoyment of their right to sexual and reproductive health.

To develop statistical models predicting disease progression and outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), using data from ECLIPSE, a large, observational study of current and former smokers with COPD. Methods. Based on a conceptual model of COPD disease progression and data from 2164 patients, associations were made between baseline characteristics, COPD disease progression attributes (exacerbations, lung function, exercise capacity, and symptoms), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and survival. Linear and nonlinear functional forms of random intercept models were used to characterize these relationships. Endogeneity was addressed by time-lagging variables in the regression models. Results. At the 5% significance level, an exacerbation history in the year before baseline was associated with increased risk of future exacerbations (moderate: + 125.8%; severe: + 89.2%) and decline in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) (-94.20 mL per year). Each 1% increase in FEV1 % predicted was associated with decreased risk of exacerbations (moderate: -1.1%; severe: -3.0%) and increased 6-minute walk test distance (6MWD) (11.5 m). Increases in baseline exercise capacity (6MWD, per meter) were associated with slightly increased risk of moderate exacerbations (+ 0.04%) and increased FEV1 (10.62 mL). Symptoms (dyspnea, cough, and/or sputum) were associated with an increased risk of moderate exacerbations (113.4% to 131.1%), and baseline dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council score >= 2 v. < 2) was associated with lower FEV1 (-112.3 mL). Conclusions. A series of linked statistical regression equations have been developed to express associations between indicators of COPD disease severity and HRQoL and survival.

Data from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry, including on newly diagnosed cancer patients, were linked to the PHARMO Database Network, including information on inand out-patient drug use. Patients diagnosed with OC between January 2000 and December 2010 were selected. An algorithm was used to identify separate lines of treatment. Data were studied descriptively. Detailed data on systemic drug use were available for 261 patients (17%) with OC. In first-line treatment, 87% of the patients (227/ 261) received platinum-based chemotherapy. Of the 161 patients receiving second-line treatment, 101 patients (63%) received platinum-based chemotherapy. In third line, this was 51% (53/ 103). The median number of treatment lines received by patients was two (interquartile range 1-3), and eight or more lines of chemotherapy were identified for 12 patients. Median survival from diagnosis onwards was 47 months from the end of first-line treatment, median survival was 32 months, and from the end of second-line treatment, it was 14 months.

Results: The mission of most patient registries is improving patient health by improving the quality of patient care; monitoring and evaluating patient care is often the primary goal (""the Why""). It is important to align the objectives of the registry and agree on a clear and functional governance structure with all stakeholders (""the Who""). There is often a trade off between reliability, validity, and specificity of data elements and feasibility of data collection (""the What""). Patient privacy should be carefully protected, and address (inter-)national and local regulations. Patient registries can reveal unique safety information, but it can be challenging to comply with pharmacovigilance guidelines (""the How"").

Results: Across studies, family-based treatments produced modest, yet long-lasting, treatment effects (mean d = 0.25 for antisocial behavior, 0.24 overall) relative to comparison conditions. Furthermore, certain characteristics moderated the magnitude of treatment effects; for example, measures of substance use showed the largest effects and measures of peer relationships showed the smallest effects.

Our analysis reveals that inspectors engage with colleagues, managers, and stakeholders to include other perspectives, gain mandate, and broaden their repertoire. At the CQC, inspectors use their discretion collectively; on their own initiative, they involve others in balancing and interpreting rules to reach judgments. At the JIY, teamwork is central and regulatory teams are granted collective discretionary room. We argue that collective work permits both responsiveness and consistency.

This longitudinal study was performed in the context of a larger evaluation study of the Zichtbare Schakels'(Visible Link) programme, conducted to determine the quality of care provided by community nurses to community-dwelling frail people in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. For the current study, clients seen by community workers in Rotterdam between July 2013 and November 2014 participated. Data were gathered via personal interviews by the community nurses as part of care delivery at the start (T0; n=220) and end of care delivery (T1; n=111 - the remaining 109 clients were still receiving care) to evaluate and improve quality of care. We measured client's quality of life (using the EQ5D), self-management abilities (using the Self-Management Ability Scale) and background characteristics. Results showed that clients seen by the community nurses especially experience problems when it comes to usual activities and pain/discomfort. Furthermore, quality of life was much worse among clients of the community nurses (0.51) than among frail older (aged 70years) people in Rotterdam (0.61), Dutch patients with chronic illnesses [CVD (0.83), COPD (0.79) or diabetes (0.83)] and older (aged 65years) people who had recently been hospitalised (0.80). Significant improvements were seen in client's self-management and quality of life over time. Self-management abilities at T0 and changes in self-management abilities (T1 - T0) clearly predicted quality of life at T1.

Conceptual framework and empirical evidence,"If consumers have a choice of health plan, risk selection is often a serious problem (e.g., as in Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, the United States of America, and Switzerland). Risk selection may threaten the quality of care for chronically ill people, and may reduce the affordability and efficiency of healthcare. Therefore, an important question is: how can the regulator show evidence of (no) risk selection? Although this seems easy, showing such evidence is not straightforward. The novelty of this paper is two-fold. First, we provide a conceptual framework for showing evidence of risk selection in competitive health insurance markets. It is not easy to disentangle risk selection and the insurers' efficiency. We suggest two methods to measure risk selection that are not biased by the insurers' efficiency. Because these measures underestimate the true risk selection, we also provide a list of signals of selection that can be measured and that, in particular in combination, can show evidence of risk selection. It is impossible to show the absence of risk selection. Second, we empirically measure risk selection among the switchers, taking into account the insurers' efficiency. Based on 2-year administrative data on healthcare expenses and risk characteristics of nearly all individuals with basic health insurance in the Netherlands (N > 16 million) we find significant risk selection for most health insurers. This is the first publication of hard empirical evidence of risk selection in the Dutch health insurance market.",Risk selection,Health Care Sciences & Services

This paper investigates two potential strategies to reduce adverse selection: (1) differentiating the premium to the duration of the contract for which the VD holds (ex-ante approach) and (2) differentiating the premium to the number of years for which insured have opted for a VD (ex-post approach). It can be hypothesized that premiums will decrease with the duration of the contract or the number of years for which insured have opted for a VD, providing an incentive to insured to opt for a deductible also in (incidental) years they expect relatively high expenses. To test this hypothesis, we examine which premium patterns would occur under these strategies using data on healthcare expenses and risk characteristics of over 750,000 insured from 6 years. Our results show that, under the assumptions made, only without risk equalization the premiums could decrease with the duration of the contract or the number of years for which insured have opted for a VD. With (sophisticated) risk equalization, decreasing premiums seem unfeasible, both under the ex-ante and ex-post approach. Given these findings, we are sceptical about the feasibility of these strategies to counteract adverse selection.",Voluntary deductibles,Health Care Sciences & Services

Studies that investigated the effect of different political regimes on health outcomes show inconsistent results. Methods: Bayesian time-series cross-section analyses are used to examine the overall impact of regional politics on variations in Italian regional life expectancy (LE) at birth during the period 1980-2010. Our analyses control for trends in and unobserved determinants of regional LE, correct for temporal as well as spatial autocorrelation, and employ a flexible specification for the timing of the political effects. Results: In the period from 1980 to 1995, we find no evidence that the communist, left-oriented coalitions and Christian Democratic, centre-oriented coalitions have had an effect on regional LE. In the period from 1995 onwards, after a major reconfiguration of Italy's political regimes and a major healthcare reform, we again find no evidence that the Centre-Left and Centre-Right coalitions have had a significant impact on regional LE. Conclusion: The presented results provide no support for the notion that different regional political regimes in Italy have had a differential effect on regional LE, even though Italian regions have had considerable and increasing autonomy over healthcare and health-related policies and expenditures.",Italy,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper presents a summary of the company submission (CS), the ERG report, subsequent addenda, and the development of the NICE guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the Appraisal Committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of AAP based on the CS. An important question in this appraisal was, according to the ERG, whether AAP followed by docetaxel is more effective than BSC followed by docetaxel. In the COU-AA-302 trial, 239 of 546 (43.8 %) AAP patients and 304 of 542 (56.1 %) BSC patients received docetaxel as subsequent therapy, following AA or placebo. The results for this specific group of patients were not presented in the CS; therefore, the ERG asked the company to provide these data in the clarification letter; however, these data were presented as commercial-in-confidence and cannot therefore be reported here. The ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns, including (a) not using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population; (b) inconsistencies in estimating prediction equations; (c) not fully incorporating the impact of adverse events; (d) incorrectly incorporating the new patient access scheme (PAS); and (e) the assumption that AA non-compliance leads to recoverable drug costs. Although some of these issues were adjusted in the ERG base case, the ERG could not estimate the impact of all of these issues, and thus acknowledges that there are still uncertainties concerning the cost-effectiveness evidence. With the exception of the ERG's preference for using the ITT population, the AC agreed with the approach taken in the ERG base case. The original company and ERG base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were A 46,722 pound and A 57,688 pound per QALY gained, respectively; these changed to A 28,563 pound and A 38,061 pound per QALY gained, respectively, in the revised base cases applying a new PAS. Regarding the end-of-life criteria, after 24 months approximately 63 % of patients in the control group of the COU-AA-302 trial were still alive, and the median survival was 30.1 months (95 % CI 27.3-34.1). Therefore, it is unlikely that life expectancy would be less than 24 months. The AC stated that the most plausible ICER is likely between A 28,600 pound and A 32,800 pound per QALY gained, and concluded that AAP at this stage in the treatment pathway did not meet the end-of-life criterion for short life expectancy. Moreover, in March 2016, the AC produced the final guidance, stating that AAP is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating mCRPC.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Health insurers were provided with strong incentives to compete and more room to negotiate and selectively contract with health care providers. Nevertheless, the bargaining position of health insurers vis-a-vis both GPs and hospitals is still relatively weak. GPs are very well organized in a powerful national interest association (LHV) and effectively exploit the long-standing trust relationship with their patients. They have been very successful in mobilizing public support against unfavorable contracting practices of health insurers and enforcement of the competition act. The rapid establishment of multidisciplinary care groups to coordinate care for patients with chronic diseases further strengthened their position. Due to ongoing horizontal consolidation, hospital markets in the Netherlands have become highly concentrated. Only recently the Dutch competition authority prohibited the first hospital merger. Despite the highly concentrated health insurance market, it is unclear whether insurers will have sufficient countervailing buyer power vis-a-vis GPs and hospitals to effectively fulfill their role as prudent buyer of care, as envisioned in the reform. To prevent further consolidation and anticompetitive coordination, strict enforcement of competition policy is crucially important for safeguarding the potential for effective insurer-provider negotiations about quality and price.

Often involving the notion of cost-effectiveness, one of the key characteristics of such assessments tends to be the consideration of efficiency as a static outcome; with a strong emphasis on current health gains but a disregard for the impact of decision making on the potential health value over time. In this article, we argue that current systems using cost-effectiveness thresholds may provide an incomplete indicator of value. We defend the idea that funding decisions should also be informed by dynamic efficiency considerations and reflect both the current and the future value of achieving a certain level of effectiveness in a specific disease area.

The National Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) employs an efficiency frontier (EF) framework to facilitate setting maximum reimbursable prices for new interventions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) is used when yes/no reimbursement decisions are sought based on a fixed threshold. In the IQWiG framework, an additional layer of complexity arises as the EF itself may vary its shape in each PSA iteration, and thus the willingness-to-pay, indicated by the EF segments, may vary. Objectives. To explore the practical problems arising when, within the EF approach, maximum reimbursable prices for new interventions are sought through PSA. Methods. When the EF is varied in a PSA, cost recommendations for new interventions may be determined by the mean or the median of the distances between each intervention's point estimate and each EF. Implications of using these metrics were explored in a simulation study based on the model used by IQWiG to assess the cost-effectiveness of 4 antidepressants. Results. Depending on the metric used, cost recommendations can be contradictory. Recommendations based on the mean can also be inconsistent. Results (median) suggested that costs of duloxetine, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and bupropion should be decreased by Euro131, Euro29, Euro12, and Euro99, respectively. These recommendations were implemented and the analysis repeated. New results suggested keeping the costs as they were. The percentage of acceptable PSA outcomes increased 41% on average, and the uncertainty associated to the net health benefit was significantly reduced. Conclusions. The median of the distances between every intervention outcome and every EF is a good proxy for the cost recommendation that would be given should the EF be fixed. Adjusting costs according to the median increased the probability of acceptance and reduced the uncertainty around the net health benefit distribution, resulting in a reduced uncertainty for decision makers.",decision analysis,Medical Informatics

Two common elicitation formats are the direct measurement of a subjective point estimate of life expectancy and the assessment of survival probabilities to a range of target ages. This study presents one of the few direct comparisons of these two methods. Results from a representative sample of the Dutch population indicate that respondents on average gave higher estimates of longevity using survival probabilities (83.6 years) compared to point estimates (80.2 years). Individual differences between elicitation methods were smaller for younger respondents and for respondents with a higher socioeconomic status. The correlation between the subjective longevity estimations was moderate, but their associations with respondents' characteristics were similar. Our results are in line with existing literature and suggest that findings from both elicitation methods may not be directly comparable, especially in certain subgroups of the population.

Formal mechanisms protecting households against the financial consequences of shocks are largely absent, especially among poor rural households. Our aim is to identify the relative importance of health shocks and to explore factors associated with coping behaviour and foregone care. We use a cross-sectional survey among 1226 randomly selected agricultural households in Kenya. In our sample, illness and injury shocks dominate all other shocks in prevalence. Almost 2% of households incurred catastrophic health expenditure in the last year. Using a probit model we identified the main coping strategies associated with facing a health shock: (1) use savings, (2) sell assets and (3) ask for gifts or loans. One in five households forewent necessary care in the last 12 months. We conclude that health shocks pose a significant risk to households. Implementing pre-payment or saving mechanisms might help protect households against the financial consequences of ill health. Such mechanisms, however, should take into account the competing shocks that agricultural households face, making it almost impossible to reserve a share of their limited resources for the protection against health shocks only.",foregone care,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

We focus on the actors responsible for the internal governance (Board of Directors and Supervisory Boards) and the external regulation (the Healthcare Inspectorate) of hospitals. In the paper, we explore the institutional work of these actors, more specifically how institutional work results from and is influenced by institutional layering and how this in turn influences the institutional makeup of both healthcare organizations and their institutional context. Our approach allowed us to see that layering changes the activities of actors in the public sector, can be used to strengthen one's position but also presents actors with new struggles, which they in turn can try to overcome by relating and using the institutionally layered context. Layering and institutional work are therefore in continuous interaction. Combining institutional layering with a focus on the lived experiences of actors and their institutional work makes it possible to move into the layered arrangement and better understand its consequences.",regulation,Public Administration

Views of the Public in the Netherlands,"Objectives: Recent debates in the Netherlands on health care priority setting have focused on the relative value of gains generated by life extending medicines for people with a terminal illness, mostly new cancer drugs. These treatments are generally expensive, provide relatively small health gains, and therefore usually do not meet common cost per QALY thresholds. Nevertheless, these drugs may be provided under the assumption that there is public support for making a special case for treatments for people with a terminal illness. This study investigated the views of the public in the Netherlands on a range of equity and efficiency considerations relevant to priority setting and examines whether there is public support for making such a special case. Methods: Using Q methodology, three viewpoints on important principles for priority setting were identified. Data were collected through ranking exercises conducted by 46 members of the general public in the Netherlands, including 11 respondents with personal experience with cancer. Results: Viewpoint 1 emphasized that people have equal rights to healthcare and opposed priority setting on any ground. Viewpoint 2 emphasized that the care for terminal patients should at all times respect the patients' quality of life, which sometimes means refraining from invasive treatments. Viewpoint 3 had a strong focus on effective and efficient care and had no moral objection against priority setting under certain circumstances. Conclusions: Overall, we found little public support for the assumption that health gains in terminally ill patients are more valuable than those in other patients.

It allows gathering more robust evidence regarding effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of new technologies without delaying market access. Nevertheless, the literature suggests that ending reimbursement and provision of a technology when it proves not to be effective or cost-effective in practice may be difficult. Objectives: To investigate how policymakers and the general public in the Netherlands value removing a previously reimbursed treatment from the basic benefits package relative to not including a new treatment. Methods: To investigate this issue, we used discrete-choice experiments. Mixed multinomial logit models were used to analyze the data. Compensating variation values and changes in probability of acceptance were calculated for withdrawal of reimbursement. Results: The results show that, ceteris paribus, both the general public (n = 1169) and policymakers (n = 90) prefer a treatment that is presently reimbursed over one that is presently not yet reimbursed. Conclusions: Apparently, ending reimbursement is more difficult than not starting reimbursement in the first place, both for policymakers and for the public. Loss aversion is one of the possible explanations for this result. Policymakers in health care need to be aware of this effect before engaging in conditional reimbursement schemes.",medical technologies,Health Care Sciences & Services

The Emergence of a Live-in Migrant Care Market and the Restructuring of the Dutch Long-term Care System,"In recent years, a live-in migrant care (LIMC) market has emerged in European countries with specific care, migration, and employment regime features. In countries with relatively low levels of formal long-term care (LTC) provision, people in need of care and their families have started purchasing LTC directly from individual - mostly migrant - workers who live-in with the person in need of care. Previous research has shown that this arrangement is facilitated by the availability of cash-for-care benefits that can be freely used by the beneficiaries, and/or by low levels of regulation of employment and migration. The Netherlands traditionally features strong, universal and generous LTC policies. However, recently, the phenomenon of LIMC has also appeared there. Based on exploratory qualitative research, this article examines the features of Dutch LIMC and the factors that foster or hinder its development. Our findings show that the ongoing restructuring of the Dutch LTC system - particularly the emphasis on informal care and decreasing accessibility of institutional care - are important factors pushing an LIMC market. At the same time, various institutional factors limit its growth, particularly the high levels of regulation of the Dutch care, migration and employment regimes. Further cutbacks in the care sector might push more families to this market in the near future, and change the character of the Dutch LTC sector. The Dutch case is relevant for other countries with longstanding traditions of generous LTC services which currently undergo retrenchment, and sheds light on routes to institutional change.",Live-in migrant care,Social Work

France has the lowest stroke incidence and mortality, followed by Netherland and UK, while Romania has higher rates. GPs ormedical specialists are responsible for AF treatment; exception are the special thrombosis services in the Netherlands. Prevention measurements are only present in UK through screening programs. Although international and national guidelines are available, undertreatment is present in all countries. Despite differences in healthcare systems and management of AF, epidemiology is comparable between three of the countries. Romania is an outlier, by being limited in data accessibility.

In particular, many claim that so-called complex interventions' pose different challenges to evaluation studies than apparently simple interventions' do. Distinct ways of doing evaluation entail particular ontologies and epistemologies of complexity. They differ in terms of whether they define complexity as a quantitative trait of interventions, whether they see evaluation as part of or outside the intervention, and whether complexity can be regarded as an emergent property of the intervention and its evaluation. In practice, evaluators and commissioners of large health care improvement programmes rely on different, sometimes contradictory, repertoires about what it means to conduct a good' evaluation. This is an ongoing matter negotiated between and among commissioners, researchers, andsometimesprogramme managers. In particular, notions of evaluability, usefulness and distance/independence are problematised in different ways and with diverse consequences, which, in turn, produce other notions and layers of complexity such as temporal, institutional and affective complexities. When (social science) researchers claim that one method or another is better able to grasp complexity, they elide the issue that any methodological choice emphasises some complexities and lets others fade into the background. Analysing the practicalities and emotions involved in evaluation studies opens up the notion of complexity to analytical scrutiny, and suggests a basis for co-theorising between biomedical, public health and social scientists (including Science and Technology Studies scholars).",The Netherlands,History & Philosophy of Science

We first present the misconception about the relation between facts and values that is since long misleading the conduct of HTA and underlies the current assessment-appraisal split. We then argue that HTA should instead be explicitly organized as an ongoing evidence-informed deliberative process, that facilitates learning among stakeholders. This has important consequences for whose values to consider, how to deal with vested interests, how to consider all values in the decision-making process, and how to communicate decisions. This is in stark contrast to how HTA processes are implemented now. It is time to set the stage for HTA as learning.",Evidence-Informed Deliberative Processes,Health Care Sciences & Services

Therefore, this study investigated which components and subsequent instruments should be part of a holistic assessment in secondary care. We also explored which data need to be exchanged for an adequate transfer of patients between primary and secondary care, and vice versa. A cross-sectional Web-based survey was conducted among Dutch healthcare professionals using a Delphi-like procedure; these included professionals working in primary or secondary care, medical advisors of health insurance companies and patients' representatives. The national guidelines were used as a starting point, resulting in a questionnaire addressing 55 components related to a comprehensive diagnostic assessment, covering the domains physiological impairments, symptoms, functional limitations and quality of life. Of the 151 experts and stakeholders invited, 92 (60.9%) completed the first round and 79 (52.3%) the second round; most respondents were pulmonologists. There was a high level of agreement between respondents from primary versus secondary care regarding which components should be measured during a comprehensive assessment of patients with asthma or COPD in secondary care and the instruments to measure these components.

This may reflect a lack of understanding of how the spillover effect of illness can be appropriately quantified. In this study we used three different approaches to quantify health spillovers resulting from meningitis. We conducted a survey of 1218 family networks affected by meningitis and used regression modelling to estimate spillover effects. The findings show that meningitis had long-term effects on family members' health, particularly affecting the likelihood of family members reporting anxiety and depression. These effects extended beyond a single close family member. These findings suggest that vaccinating against meningitis will bring significant health benefits not just to those that might have contracted the illness but also to their family networks. In methodological terms, different approaches for quantifying health spillovers provided broadly consistent results. The choice of method will be influenced by the ease of collecting primary data from family members in intervention contexts. (c) 2015 The Authors.

Previous research has shown that 11 % of the Dutch insured opted for a voluntary deductible (VD) in health insurance in 2014, while the highest VD level was financially profitable for almost 50 % of the population in retrospect. To explain this discrepancy, this paper identifies and discusses six potential determinants of the decision to opt for a VD from the behavioral economic literature: loss aversion, risk attitude, ambiguity aversion, debt aversion, omission bias, and liquidity constraints. Based on these determinants, five potential strategies are proposed to increase the number of insured opting for a VD. Presenting the VD as the default option and providing transparent information regarding the VD are the two most promising strategies. If, as a result of these strategies, more insured would opt for a VD, moral hazard would be reduced.",Nudge theory,Health Care Sciences & Services

Cost-effectiveness analysis presented as cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained has been controversial, raising heated support and opposition. Objectives: To assess the impact of economic evaluation in decisions on what to fund in four European countries and discuss the implications of our findings. Methods: We used a protocol to review the key features of the application of economic evaluation in reimbursement decision making in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, reporting country-specific highlights. Results: Although the institutions and processes vary by country, health economic evaluation has had limited impact on restricting access of controversial high-cost drugs. Even in those countries that have gone the furthest, ways have been found to avoid refusing to fund high-cost drugs for particular diseases including cancer, multiple sclerosis, and orphan diseases. Economic evaluation may, however, have helped some countries to negotiate price reductions for some drugs. It has also extended to the discussion of clinical effectiveness to include cost. Conclusions: The differences in approaches but similarities in outcomes suggest that health economic evaluation be viewed largely as rhetoric (in D.N. McCloskey's terms in The Rhetoric of Economics, 1985). This is not to imply that economics had no impact: rather that it usually contributed to the discourse in ways that differed by country. The reasons for this no doubt vary by perspective, from political science to ethics. Economic evaluation may have less to do with rationing or denial of medical treatments than to do with expanding the discourse used to discuss such issues.",reimbursement,Health Care Sciences & Services

A recently developed tool, the assessment of burden of COPD (ABC) tool, can be used in this transition to facilitate self-management support and shared decision-making. We performed a qualitative study, in which we collected and analysed the data using the methods of conventional content analyses. We performed in-depth interviews consisting of mainly open questions. Fifteen healthcare providers and 21 patients were interviewed who had worked with the ABC tool in daily care. In general, participants responded positively to the tool. Healthcare providers felt the visual representation provided was effective and comprehensible for patients and provided them with insight into their disease, a finding that patients confirmed. If patients were allowed to choose between a consultation with or without the ABC tool, the majority would prefer using the tool: it provides them with an overview and insight, which makes it easier to discuss all relevant topics related to COPD.

The Ghanaian government implemented the National Health Insurance Scheme in 2004 and the aim of this study is to evaluate its early effects on maternal and infant healthcare use. We exploit data on births before and after the intervention and apply propensity score matching to limit the bias arising from self-selection into the health insurance. About forty percent of children had a mother who is enrolled in this insurance. The scheme significantly increased the proportion of pregnancies with at least four antenatal care visits with 7 percentage points and had a significant effect on attended deliveries (10 percentage points). Caesarean sections increased (6 percentage points) and the number of children born from an unwanted pregnancy decreased (7 percentage points). Insurance enrollment had almost no effect on child vaccinations. Among the poorest forty percent of the sample, the effects of the scheme on antenatal care and attended deliveries were similar. However, the effects of the scheme on caesarean sections were about half the size (3 percentage points) and the reduction in unwanted pregnancies was larger (10 percentage points) compared to the effects in the full sample. We conclude that in the first years of operation, the National Health Insurance Scheme had a modest impact on the use of antenatal and delivery care.

We apply a decomposition method to unravel the contributions of income growth, income inequality and differential income mobility across socio-demographic groups to changes in health disparities by income in Spain using longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Living Conditions for the period 2004-2012. We find a modest rise in health inequality by income in Spain in the 5 years of economic growth prior to the start of the crisis in 2008, but a sharp fall after 2008. The drop mainly derives from the fact that loss of employment and earnings has disproportionately affected the incomes of the younger and healthier groups rather than the (mainly stable pension) incomes of the groups over 65 years. This suggests that unequal distribution of income protection by age may reduce health inequality in the short run after an economic recession.

However, trends in QALE by education or other socio-economic measure have not yet been reported. This study investigates changes in QALE stratified by educational level for the Dutch population in the period 2001-2011. Methods: Using data from multiple sources, we estimated mortality rates and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as functions of age, gender, calendar year and educational level. Subsequently, predictions from these regressions were combined for calculating QALE at ages 25 and 65. QALE changes were decomposed into effects of mortality and HRQoL. Results: In 2001-2011, QALE increased for men and women at all educational levels, the largest increases being for highly educated resulting in a widening gap by education. In 2001, at age 25, the absolute QALE difference between the low and the highly educated was 7.4 healthy years (36.7 vs. 44.1) for men and 6.3 healthy years (39.5 vs. 45.8) for women. By 2011, the QALE difference increased to 8.1 healthy years (38.8 vs. 46.9) for men and to 7.1 healthy years (41.3 vs. 48.4) for women. Similar results were observed at age 65. Although the gap was largely attributable to widening inequalities in mortality, widening inequalities in HRQoL were also substantial. Conclusions: In the Netherlands, population health as measured by QALE has improved, but QALE inequalities have widened more than inequalities in life expectancy alone.",,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

So far, this so-called 'reactive transnationalism' has not been studied extensively. Based on literature on discrimination and transnationalism, reactive transnationalism is expected to be most prominent among socioeconomically successful migrants, particularly among males and those who consider themselves Muslims. Our research among middle-class migrants in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, indeed shows that the more respondents experienced discrimination, the more transnationally involved they are, both regarding transnational identifications and transnational activities. While no gender difference was found regarding reactive transnational activities, for women perceived discrimination proves to lead to stronger instead of weaker transnational identifications than for men. The fact that no difference was found between Muslim and non-Muslim respondents regarding reactive transnationalism suggests that, despite heated public debates about 'Islam', in the Netherlands, ethnic divides - being considered as 'Dutch' or 'non-Dutch' - are even more prominent than religious ones.",TRANSNATIONALISM,Sociology

The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the outcomes after AVR with bioprostheses and allografts reported in the last 15 years. We conducted a systematic literature review (PROSPERO register: CRD42015017041) of studies published between 2000-15. Inclusion criteria were observational studies or randomized controlled trials reporting on outcomes of AVR with bioprostheses (stented or stentless) or allografts, with or without coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or valve repair procedure, with study population size n a parts per thousand yen 30 and mean follow-up length a parts per thousand yen5 years. Fifty-four bioprosthesis studies and 14 allograft studies were included, encompassing 55 712 and 3872 patients and 349 840 and 32 419 patient-years, respectively. We pooled early mortality risk and linearized occurrence rates of valve-related events, reintervention and late mortality in a random-effects model. Sensitivity, meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the influence of outliers on the pooled estimates and to explore sources of heterogeneity. Funnel plots were used to investigate publication bias. Pooled early mortality risks for bioprostheses and allografts were 4.99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.44-5.62) and 5.03% (95% CI, 3.61-7.01), respectively. The late mortality rate was 5.70%/patient-year (95% CI, 4.99-5.62) for bioprostheses and 1.68%/patient-year (95% CI, 1.23-2.28) for allografts. Pooled reintervention rates for bioprostheses and allografts were 0.75%/patient-year (95% CI, 0.61-0.91) and 1.87%/patient-year (95% CI, 1.52-2.31), respectively. There was substantial heterogeneity in most outcomes. Meta-regression analyses identified covariates that could explain the heterogeneity: implantation period, valve type, patient age, gender, pre-intervention New York Heart Association class III/IV, concomitant CABG, study design and follow-up length. There is possible publication bias in all outcomes. This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis provides an overview of the outcomes after AVR with bioprostheses and allografts reported during the last 15 years. The results of this study can support patients and doctors in the prosthetic valve choice and can be used in microsimulation models to predict patient outcomes and estimate the cost-effectiveness of AVR with bioprostheses or allografts compared with current and future heart valve prostheses.",Meta-analysis,Surgery

Objective The aim of this study is to systematically map the debate on this new role for pharmacists amongst all stakeholders to uncover and understand the controversy and consensus. Setting: Primary health care in the Netherlands. Method Q methodology. 163 participants rank-ordered statements on issues concerning the integration of a non-dispensing pharmacist in primary care practice. Main outcome measure: Stakeholder perspectives on the role of the non-dispensing pharmacist and pharmaceutical care in primary care. Results This study identified the consensus on various features of the non-dispensing pharmacist role as well as the financial, organisational and collaborative aspects of integrating a non-dispensing pharmacist in primary care practice. Q factor analysis revealed four perspectives: ""the independent community pharmacist"", ""the independent clinical pharmacist"", ""the dependent clinical pharmacist"" and ""the medication therapy management specialist"". These four perspectives show controversies to do with the level of professional independency of the non-dispensing pharmacist and the level of innovation of task performance. Conclusion Despite the fact that introducing new professional roles in healthcare can lead to controversy, the results of this Q study show the potential of a non-dispensing pharmacist as a pharmaceutical care provider and the willingness for interprofessional collaboration.

While the operating rooms are struggling to meet demand, they face idle times because of (human) resources being pulled away for other urgent demands, and cancellations for economic and health reasons. In this research we analyze the resulting stochastic operating room scheduling problems, and the improvements attainable by scheduled cancellations to accommodate the large demand while avoiding the negative consequences of excessive overtime work. We present a three-stage recourse model which formalizes the scheduled cancellations and is anticipative to further uncertainty. We develop a solution method for this three-stage model which relies on the sample average approximation and the L-shaped method. The method exploits the structure of optimal solutions to speed up the optimization. Scheduled cancellations can significantly and substantially improve the operating room schedule when the costs of cancellations are close to the costs of overtime work. Moreover, the proposed methods illustrate how the adverse impact of cancellations (by patients) for economic and health reasons can be largely controlled. The (human) resource unavailability however is shown to cause a more than proportional loss of solution value for the surgery scheduling problems occurring in China's large city hospitals, even when applying the proposed solution techniques, and requires different management measures.

The trade-off between premium and provider choice,"Within a healthcare system with managed competition, health insurers are expected to act as prudent buyers of care on behalf of their customers. To fulfil this role adequately, understanding consumer preferences for health plan characteristics is of vital importance. Little is known, however, about these preferences and how they vary across consumers. Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) we quantified trade-offs between basic health plan characteristics and analysed whether there are differences in preferences according to age, health status and income. We selected four health plan characteristics to be included in the DCE: (i) the level of provider choice and associated level of reimbursement, (ii) the primary focus of provider contracting (price, quality, social responsibility), (iii) the level of service benefits, and (iv) the monthly premium. This selection was based on a literature study, expert interviews and focus group discussions. The DCE consisted of 17 choice sets, each comprising two hypothetical health plan alternatives. A representative sample (n = 533) of the Dutch adult population,. based on age, gender and educational level, completed the online questionnaire during the annual open enrolment period for 2015. The final model with four latent classes showed that being able to choose a care provider freely was by far the most decisive characteristic for respondents aged, over 45, those with chronic conditions, and those with a gross income over (sic)3000/month. Monthly premium was the most important choice determinant for young, healthy, and lower income respondents. We conclude that it would be very unlikely for half of the sample to opt for health plans with restricted provider choice. However, a premium discount up to (sic)15/month by restricted health plans might motivate especially younger, healthier, and less wealthy consumers to choose these plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We adapted the Dutch COPD Model by using English and Scottish demographic, COPD incidence, COPD prevalence, smoking prevalence and mortality data to make projections. In England, the prevalence of COPD was estimated to be 1.79% (95% uncertainty interval 1.77-1.81) in 2011, increasing to 2.19% (1.85-2.33) by 2030. In Scotland, prevalence was 2.03% (1.96-2.10) in 2011 increasing to 2.20% (1.98-2.40) in 2030. These increases were driven by more women developing COPD.

Methods: A consortium of COPD modeling groups completed three tasks. First, they reported all patient characteristics included in the model and provided the level of detail in which the input parameters were specified. Second, groups simulated disease progression, mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs for hypothetical subgroups of patients that differed in terms of sex, age, smoking status, and lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] % predicted). Finally, model outcomes for exacerbations and mortality for subgroups of patients were validated against published subgroup results of two large COPD trials. Results: Nine COPD modeling groups participated. Most models included sex (seven), age (nine), smoking status (six), and FEV1% predicted (nine), mainly to specify disease progression and mortality. Trial results showed higher exacerbation rates for women (found in one model), higher mortality rates for men (two models), lower mortality for younger patients (four models), and higher exacerbation and mortality rates in patients with severe COPD (four models). Conclusions: Most currently available COPD cost-effectiveness models are able to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of personalized treatment on the basis of sex, age, smoking, and FEV1% predicted. Treatment in COPD is, however, more likely to be personalized on the basis of clinical parameters. Two models include several clinical patient characteristics and are therefore most suitable to evaluate personalized treatment, although some important clinical parameters are still missing.",validation,Health Care Sciences & Services

Data are drawn from eight household surveys between 2000 and 2013, including two Demographic and Health Surveys, one Family Health Survey and five Family Income and Expenditure Surveys. We find that out-of-pocket spending increased by 150% (real) from 2000 to 2012, with the sharpest increases occurring in recent years. The main driver of health spending is medicines, accounting for almost two-thirds of total health spending, and as much as three-quarters among the poor. The incidence of catastrophic payments has tripled since 2000, from 2.5% to 7.7%. The percentage of people impoverished by health spending has also increased and, in 2012, out-of-pocket spending on health added 1.5 percentage points to the poverty rate, pushing more than 1.5 million people into poverty. In light of these findings, recent policies to enhance financial risk protection-such as the expansion of government-subsidized health insurance from the poor to the near-poor, a policy of zero copayments for the poor, a deepening of the benefit package and provider payment reform aimed at cost-containment-are to be commended. Indeed, between 2008 and 2013, self-reported health insurance coverage increased across all quintiles and its distribution became more pro-poor. To speed progress toward financial protection goals, quick wins could include issuing health insurance cards to the poor to increase awareness of coverage and limiting out-of-pocket spending by clearly defining a clear copayment structure for non-poor members. An in-depth analysis of the pharmaceutical sector would help to shed light on why medicines impose such a large financial burden on households.",trends,Health Care Sciences & Services

An Evaluation of the Validity and Interpretability of the EQ-5D-5L and Preference-Based Questionnaires Derived from the EORTC QLQ-C30,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the validity and interpretability of different preference-based questionnaires (generic 5-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire [EQ-5D-54 cancer-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire Preference-Based Measure, and European Organization of Randomized Controlled Trials 8 Dimension [EORTC-8D]) in patients with acute leukemia. Methods: Patients who participated in Hemato-Oncologie voor Volwassenen Nederland (HOVON- the Haemato Oncology Foundation for Adults in the Netherlands) clinical trials between 1999 and 2011 at a single hospital were invited to complete the questionnaires. Interpretability was evaluated by the frequency of incomplete data and highest and lowest possible scores. Content validity was evaluated by exploring the health-related quality-of-life domains included in the questionnaires. Construct validity was assessed using correlations with other quality of-life scales (EQ-visual analogue scale score and global quality-of-life scale of the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire) and ability to distinguish between patients with different health statuses. Results: Questionnaires were returned by 89% (111 of 125) of the patients. Six to seven respondents did not return full questionnaires. Perfect health on the EQ-5D-5L was reported by 32 respondents and many of them (N = 17) did report health problems on other questionnaires. All questionnaires were strongly correlated (range 0.61-0.78) with other quality-of-life scales and yielded substantially different utility values for patients with different health statuses. Nevertheless, the disease specific preference-based questionnaires showed greater discriminatory power. Conclusions: Although the Quality of Life Questionnaire Preference-Based Measure and the EORTC-8D appear to have better validity, this study does not provide any strong evidence against the use of the EQ-5D-5L for measuring quality-of-life utilities in acute leukemia.

The QALY comprises length and quality of life into one measure which allows cross-disease comparability. The quality adjustment of the QALY is based on preferences for health states. An important normative choice is the question whose preferences for states of health we wish to capture. The answer to this question is directly related to the normative question regarding the appropriate maximand in health care decisions. Currently, preferences are commonly derived from the general public, rather than from actual patients. This choice, which can have large consequences on final outcomes of economic evaluations, has always been a topic of debate. This paper clarifies and furthers the discussion regarding the appropriate source of preferences for health state valuations, acknowledges the plurality of different perspectives, and argues that health economic guidelines could require analysis of benefit in terms of QALYs based on both patient and general public preferences.

Empirical literature shows that even the most sophisticated risk equalization models-with advanced morbidity adjusters-substantially undercompensate insurers for selected groups of high-risk individuals. In the presence of premium regulation, these undercompensations confront consumers and insurers with incentives for risk selection. An important reason for the undercompensations is that not all information with predictive value regarding healthcare expenses is appropriate for use as a morbidity adjuster. To reduce incentives for selection regarding specific groups we propose overpaying morbidity adjusters that are already included in the risk equalization model. This paper illustrates the idea of overpaying by merging data on morbidity adjusters and healthcare expenses with health survey information, and derives three preconditions for meaningful application. Given these preconditions, we think overpaying may be particularly useful for pharmacy-based cost groups.",Overpaying,Health Care Sciences & Services

We document the life-cycle profile, concentration and persistence of this expenditure using claims data covering both curative and long-term care expenses for the full Dutch population. Spending on health care is strongly concentrated: the 1 per cent of individuals with the highest levels of expenditure account for one-quarter of the aggregate in any one year. Averaged over three years, the top 1 per cent still account for more than a fifth of the total, indicating a very high degree of persistence in the largest expenses. Spending on long-term care, which amounts to one-third of all expenditure on health care, is even more concentrated: the top 1 per cent account for more than half of total spending on this type of care. Average expenditure rises steeply with age and even more so with proximity to death. Spending on individuals in their last year of life absorbs one-tenth of aggregate health care expenditure. In a given year, spending on health care is highly skewed toward individuals with lower incomes. Average expenditure on the poorest fifth is more than three times that on the richest fifth.",the Netherlands,Business & Economics

In a cross-sectional mixed-methods study, the use of SeCZ TaLK in daily practice was evaluated through a web-based survey among 151 professionals in health care and education. Initially, 336 professionals had obtained the game 12-18 months earlier. In addition, twelve professionals were interviewed individually. Results showed that the actual use of SeCZ TaLK was associated with a positive attitude towards discussing sexuality, a high perceived feasibility of the game, own motivation and skills, and correspondence with work routines. The presence of preconditions (such as time to play and staffing capacity), participant's recruitment for game sessions and the professional environment were non-significant factors. Professionals appreciated the board game SeCZ TaLK but actual use depended on own motivation and skills and correspondence with work routines.

The progression of the epidemic is largely influenced by the planning of these operations. This paper introduces and analyzes five models for predicting HAT prevalence in a given village based on past observed prevalence levels and past screening activities in that village. Based on the quality of prevalence level predictions in 143 villages in Kwamouth (DRC), and based on the theoretical foundation underlying the models, we consider variants of the Logistic Model-a model inspired by the SIS epidemic model-to be most suitable for predicting HAT prevalence levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of this model to predict the effects of planning policies for screening operations. Our analysis yields an analytical expression for the screening frequency required to reach eradication (zero prevalence) and a simple approach for determining the frequency required to reach elimination within a given time frame (one case per 10000). Furthermore, the model predictions suggest that annual screening is only expected to lead to eradication if at least half of the cases are detected during the screening rounds. This paper extends knowledge on control strategies for HAT and serves as a basis for further modeling and optimization studies.",,Mathematical & Computational Biology

A Note on Trading Off Health and Happiness in Rationing Decisions,"Background: Economic evaluations typically value the effects of an intervention in terms of quality-adjusted life-years, which combine length and health-related quality of life. It has been suggested that economic evaluations should incorporate broader outcomes than health-related quality of life. Broader well-being, for instance measured as happiness, could be a better measure of the overall welfare effects in patients because of treatment. An underexplored question is whether and how people trade off information on health and broader outcomes from treatment in rationing decisions. Objectives: This article presents the results of a first experiment aimed at exploring such trade-offs between health and happiness. Methods: We used a Web-based questionnaire in a representative sample of the public from the Netherlands (N = 1015). People made choices between two groups of patients differing in terms of their health and happiness levels before treatment and gains from treatment. Results: The results showed that about half the respondents were willing to discriminate between patient groups on the basis of their health and happiness levels before and after treatment. In the trader group, health gains were considered somewhat more important than happiness gains.

This instrument is known as the EQ-5D-5L. To make the EQ-5D-5L suitable for use in economic evaluations, societal values need to be attached to all 3125 health states. Objectives: To derive a Dutch tariff for the EQ-5D-5L. Methods: Health state values were elicited during face-to-face interviews in a general population sample stratified for age, sex, and education, using composite time trade-off (cTTO) and a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Data were modeled using ordinary least squares and tobit regression (for cTTO) and a multinomial conditional logit model (for DCE). Model performance was evaluated on the basis of internal consistency, parsimony, goodness of fit, handling of left-censored values, and theoretical considerations. Results: A representative sample (N = 1003) of the Dutch population participated in the valuation study. Data of 979 and 992 respondents were included in the analysis of the cTTO and the DCE, respectively. The cTTO data were left-censored at -1. The tobit model was considered the preferred model for the tariff on the basis of its handling of the censored nature of the data, which was confirmed through comparison with the DCE data. The predicted values for the EQ-5D-5L ranged from -0.446 to 1. Conclusions: This study established a Dutch tariff for the EQ-5D-5L on the basis of cTTO. The values represent the preferences of the Dutch population. The tariff can be used to estimate the impact of health care interventions on quality of life, for example, in context of economic evaluations.",time trade-off,Health Care Sciences & Services

Methods In total 6922 employees (45-64 years) participating in the first three waves of the Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation were included. Participants yearly filled out an online questionnaires. Regression analyses were applied to study the influence of baseline work ability and work engagement on the incident use of policies during the first year of follow-up, and the incident use of these policies on work ability and work engagement during the second year of follow-up. Results Employees with a higher work ability were less likely to start using the policy 'reduced working hours' [OR 0.91 (95 % CI 0.83-0.98)]. Starting to use this policy was in turn related to lower work ability 1 year later [B -0.28 (95 % CI -0.47 to -0.08)]. Starting to use the policy 'exemption from evening/night work' was related to higher work engagement 1 year later [B 0.23 (95 % CI 0.07-0.39)]. Conclusions Low work ability precedes the use of some company policies aiming to support sustainable employability of older workers. Further research is needed to explore whether company policies result in a (longstanding) improvement, or reduced deterioration, of older workers' employability.",Older employees,Social Issues

In the unique setting of the new Dutch health care system with regulated competition, this paper evaluates the impact of a 1-year natural experiment with patient channeling on providers' market shares. In 2009 a large regional Dutch health insurer designated preferred providers for two different procedures (cataract surgery and varicose veins treatment) and gave its enrollees a positive financial incentive for choosing them. That is, patients were exempted from paying their deductible when they went to a preferred provider. Using claims data over the period 2007-2009, we apply a difference-in-difference approach to study the impact of this channeling strategy on the allocation of patients across individual providers. Our estimation results show that, in the year of the experiment, preferred providers of varicose veins treatment on average experienced a significant increase in patient volume relative to non-preferred providers. However, for cataract surgery no significant effect is found. Possible explanations for the observed difference between both procedures may be the insurer's selection of preferred providers and the design of the channeling incentive resulting in different expected financial benefits for both patient groups.",Difference-in-difference,Health Care Sciences & Services

PBF is estimated to raise the proportion of births occurring in incentivized public health facilities by 7.5 percentage points (25%). A substantial part of this effect arises from switching the location of institutional births from private to public facilities; there is no significant impact on deliveries supervised by a skilled birth attendant, nor is there any significant effect on neonatal mortality, antenatal care and vaccination rates. The impact on births in public facilities is much greater if PBF is accompanied by maternity vouchers that cover user fees, but there is no significant effect among the poorest women. Heterogeneous effects across schemes differing in design suggest that maintaining management authority within a health district while giving explicit service targets to facilities is more effective in raising utilization than contracting management to a non-governmental organization while denying it full autonomy and leaving financial penalties vague.

The rationale of giving the consumer a periodic choice of health insurer is that individual risk-bearing insurers are stimulated to effectively purchase and manage the care on behalf of their enrollees. For Europe this is largely a terra incognita, while the United States have at least fifty years of relevant experience. Twenty years ago the United States were confronted with a substantial backlash against managed care. Based on the US experience we come to the following lessons for Europe. First, the greatest backlash against managed care can be expected from the healthcare providers. Second, consumers are willing to give up to some extent their free choice of healthcare provider in return for a lower premium. Third, insurers should (be allowed to) offer consumers a choice between an insurance product with free choice of provider and lower-priced products with restricted reimbursement for non-contracted providers. Fourth, insurers should use input from consumers, provide them in a timely manner with relevant information about the (non-) contracted providers, and reassure consumers that in-network providers offer good quality care. Fifth, the development of national guidelines and quality indicators, with input from the medical profession, can increase the acceptance of managed care. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The website, with the opportunity for constant, unseen supervision, coercion through comments, and steering through edits and comments, revealed various modalities of control. While issues of control and eating disorders have been explored by others, little work has been done on how the control experienced by the young women (coercion on the individual, the body as the object of control, and the modality of pressure and supervision) interact, how control is presented in stories for a recovery-focused, monitored website, and how the website directs the content.

This study investigated the impact in the context of expensive hospital drugs. This study aimed to: (1) investigate the effect of productivity costs on cost-effectiveness outcomes, (2) determine whether economic evaluations of expensive drugs commonly include productivity costs related to paid and unpaid work, and (3) explore potential reasons for excluding productivity costs from the economic evaluation. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify economic evaluations of 33 expensive drugs. We analysed whether evaluations included productivity costs and whether inclusion or exclusion was related to the study population's age, health and national health economic guidelines. The impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes was assessed in studies that included productivity costs. Of 249 identified economic evaluations of expensive drugs, 22 (9 %) included productivity costs related to paid work. One study included unpaid productivity. Mostly, productivity cost exclusion could not be explained by the study population's age and health status, but national guidelines appeared influential. Productivity costs proved often highly influential. This study indicates that productivity costs in economic evaluations of expensive hospital drugs are commonly and inconsistently ignored in economic evaluations.

This paper provides insight into the switching behaviour of low-risks (i.e. young or healthy consumers) and high-risks (i.e. elderly or unhealthy consumers) in the Netherlands in the period 2009-2012. We analysed: (1) administrative data with objective health status information (i.e. medically diagnosed diseases and pharmaceutical use) and information on health care expenses of nearly the entire Dutch population (n=15.3 million individuals) and (2) three-year sample data (n=1152 individuals). Our findings indicate that switching rates strongly decrease with age. For example, in 2009, consumers aged 25-44 switched 10 times more than consumers aged 75 or older. Another finding is that switching rates decrease as the predicted health care expenses increase. Although healthy consumers switch twice as much as unhealthy consumers, this difference becomes much smaller after adjusting for age. We conclude that our findings can be explained by higher perceived switching costs by elderly consumers than by young consumers. Consequently, insurers have low incentives to act as quality-conscious purchasers of care for the elderly consumers. Therefore, strategies should be developed to increase the choice of insurer of elderly consumers.",I18,Health Care Sciences & Services

Using panel data from annual household surveys and data on health insurers' premiums and quality ratings over the period 2006-2012, we estimate a random effects logit model of people's switching decisions. We find that switching propensities depend on health plan price and quality, and on people's age, health, education and having supplementary or group insurance. Young people (18-35 years) are more sensitive to price, whereas older people are more sensitive to quality. Searching for health plan information has a much stronger impact on peoples' sensitivity to price than to service quality. In addition, searching for health plan information has a stronger impact on the switching propensity of higher than lower educated people, suggesting that higher educated people make better use of available health plan information.

This study used difference-in-differences (DID) models to estimate differences in health care expenditure trends before and after the introduction of a financial agreement between 9 intervention countries and 16 control countries. Intervention countries included countries with pay-for-coordination (PFC), pay-for-performance (PFP), and/or all inclusive agreements (bundled and global payment) for integrated chronic care. OECD and WHO data from 1996 to 2013 was used. The results from the main DID models showed that the annual growth of outpatient expenditure was decreased in countries with PFC (by 21.28 US$ per capita) and in countries with all-inclusive agreements (by 216.60 US$ per capita). The growth of hospital and administrative expenditure was decreased in countries with PFP by 64.50 US$ per capita and 5.74 US$ per capita, respectively. When modelling impact as a non-linear function of time during the total 4-year period after implementation, PFP decreased the growth of hospital and administrative expenditure and all-inclusive agreements reduced the growth of outpatient expenditure. Financial agreements are potentially powerful tools to stimulate integrated care and influence health care expenditure growth. A blended payment scheme that combines elements of PFC, PFP, and all-inclusive payments is likely to provide the strongest financial incentives to control health care expenditure growth.

Prediction models were developed using a combination of approaches and concepts. Methods: We used memetic algorithms to update weights and to improve prediction accuracy of models. In the first step, the optimum amount for neural network parameters such as momentum rate, transfer function, and error function were obtained through trial and error and based on the results of previous studies. In the second step, optimum parameters were applied to memetic algorithms in order to improve the accuracy of prediction. This preliminary analysis showed that the accuracy of neural networks is 88%. In the third step, the accuracy of neural network models was improved using a memetic algorithm and resulted model was compared with a logistic regression model using a confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Results: The memetic algorithm improved the accuracy from 88.0% to 93.2%. We also found that memetic algorithm had a higher accuracy than the model from the genetic algorithm and a regression model. Among models, the regression model has the least accuracy. For the memetic algorithm model the amount of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and ROC are 96.2, 95.3, 93.8, 92.4, and 0.958 respectively. Conclusions: The results of this study provide a basis to design a Decision Support System for risk management and planning of care for individuals at risk of diabetes.",Early Diagnosis,Medical Informatics

However, detailed empirical insight into why healthcare providers merge is lacking. Also, we know little about the influence of national healthcare policies on mergers. We fill this gap in the literature by conducting a survey study on mergers among 848 Dutch healthcare executives, of which 35% responded (resulting in a study sample of 239 executives). A total of 65% of the respondents was involved in at least one merger between 2005 and 2012. During this period, Dutch healthcare providers faced a number of policy changes, including increasing competition, more pressure from purchasers, growing financial risks, de-institutionalisation of long-term care and decentralisation of healthcare services to municipalities. Our empirical study shows that healthcare providers predominantly merge to improve the provision of healthcare services and to strengthen their market position. Also efficiency and financial reasons are important drivers of merger activity in healthcare. We find that motives for merger are related to changes in health policies, in particular to the increasing pressure from competitors, insurers and municipalities.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

We break service coverage into prevention and treatment, and financial protection into impoverishment and catastrophic spending; we use nationally representative household survey data to adjust population averages to capture inequalities between the poor and better off; we allow non-linear trade-offs between and within the two dimensions of the UHC index; and we express all indicators such that scores run from 0 to 100, and higher scores are better. In a sample of 24 countries for which we have detailed information on UHC-inspired reforms, we find a cluster of high-performing countries with UHC scores of between 79 and 84 (Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, and South Africa) and a cluster of low-performing countries with UHC scores in the range 35-57 (Ethiopia, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam). We find that countries have mostly improved their UHC scores between the earliest and latest years for which we have data-by about 5 points on average.

Using Watson's concept of professional talk, we study how managers in their daily work talk about professionalism of vocationally skilled care workers. Based on observations and recordings of mundane conversations by middle managers, we found four different professional talks that co-exist: (1) appropriate looks and conduct, (2) reflectivity about personal values and 'good' care, (3) methodical work methods, (4) competencies. Jointly, these professional talks constitute an important discursive resource for middle managers to facilitate change on the work floor. Change involves the reconfiguration of care work and different managerial-worker relations. Middle managers use professional talks in both enabling and disenabling ways vis-A -vis care workers. Based on these findings, we suggest a more nuanced portrayal of the relationship between managers and professionals. Rather than being based on an intrinsic opposition, i.e. 'managers versus professionals', this relationship is flexibly reconstructed via professional talk.",Professionalism,Biomedical Social Sciences

The incidence and costs of five different types of fractures (spine, hip, upper extremity, lower extremity, wrist/distal forearm, other) were derived from claims data of all Dutch healthcare insurers. Given that fracture-codes in claims data do not indicate whether fractures are related to osteoporosis, we used a large dataset with DXA measurements to attribute fractures to osteoporosis. Future projections used four scenarios: (1) demographic, (2) demographic ? annual trend in incidence rates, (3) demographic ? annual trend in incidence rates ? annual trend in costs, and (4) treatment. Of all registered fractures, 32 % was attributed to osteoporosis (36 % in women and 21 % in men). Over time 2010-2030) the increase in incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures was estimated to be 40 % (scenario 1); for the hip 60-79 % (scenario 1-2). In 2010, approximately 200 million was spent on treatment of osteoporosis-related fractures, most on fractures of the hip followed by wrist/distal forearm. In both men and women, the excess costs due to osteoporosis-related fractures were highest for hip fractures ((sic)11,000-(sic)13,000 per person), followed by spine fractures ((sic)6000-(sic)7000). The costs for osteoporosis-related fractures were projected to increase with 50 % from 2010 to 2030 (scenario 1); for the hip 60-148 % (scenario 1-3). Pharmacotherapeutic prevention can lead to cost-savings of (sic)377 million in 2030 (scenario 1 and 4 combined).

The results show that hospitals have different motives to involve patients and staff and have adapted existing methods to involve patients. Interestingly, areas of improvement proposed by patients were often already known. However, the process of co-production did contribute to quality improvement in other ways. Theprocess of co-productionstimulated hospitals' thinking about how to realize quality improvements. Quality improvements were facilitated by this process as seeing patients and hearing their experiences created a sense of urgency among staff to act on the improvement issues raised. Moreover, the experiences served to legitimatize improvements to higher management bodies. Points for practitioners Different participation methods can bring patients' experiences with healthcare services to the fore, which can be used for quality improvement. Our study shows that adapting existing methods to local hospital resources is likely to be beneficial for co-production processes within a given context. However, adapting and tailoring also poses risks. Tailoring activities, such as using criteria to select patients, influence what is considered to be legitimate patient input. In addition, as the co-production process is important, the method should consist of an organized trajectory in which patients and staff are involved and personal experiences are presented. Therefore, project teams need to critically reflect on the consequences of adaptations and tailoring actions, and their desirability, when carrying out quality improvement projects.",user participation,Public Administration

Also, we calculate cost-effectiveness of treatment sequences commonly prescribed to predict effects and costs if patients had received a different treatment sequence. Methods: Real-world data including patient and disease characteristics, treatment information and resource use were collected from 1054 elderly patients with MM. Patients received first-line treatment during 2004-2007 (cohort 1) and 2008-2013 (cohort 2). The two cohorts were compared using a patient-level simulation (PLS) model comprising regression models which used patient and disease characteristics to estimate time to next treatment and death. Effects and costs from cohort 2 were compared to 4 commonly prescribed real-world sequences. Results: Utilisation of novel agents was higher for cohort 2 compared to cohort 1.

It has been suggested that these health spillovers should be included in economic evaluation, but there is not a systematic method for doing this. In this article, we develop a framework for including health spillovers in economic evaluation. We focus on extra-welfarist economic evaluations where the objective is to maximize health benefits from a health care budget (the health care perspective). Our framework involves adapting the conventional cost-effectiveness decision rule to include 2 multiplier effects to internalize the spillover effects. These multiplier effects express the ratio of total health effects (for patients and their family networks) to patient health effects. One multiplier effect is specified for health benefit generated from providing a new intervention, one for health benefit displaced by funding this intervention. We show that using multiplier effects to internalize health spillovers could change the optimal funding decisions and generate additional health benefits to society.",spillovers,Medical Informatics

However, expected gains may be small, not necessarily outweighing considerable toxicity and high costs. Treatment choice is to a large extent dependent on preferences of doctors and patients and data on these choices are scarce. The purpose of this study is to obtain real-world information on palliative systemic treatment and costs of R/M SCCHN in the Netherlands. In six Dutch head and neck treatment centers, data were collected on patient and tumor characteristics, treatment patterns, disease progression, survival, adverse events, and resource use for R/M SCCHN, between 2006 and 2013. 125 (14 %) out of 893 R/M SCCHN patients received palliative, non-trial first-line systemic treatment, mainly platinum + 5FU + cetuximab (32 %), other platinum-based combination therapy (13 %), methotrexate monotherapy (27 %) and capecitabine monotherapy (14 %). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.4 and 6.0 months, respectively. 34 (27 %) patients experienced severe adverse events. Mean total hospital costs ranged from a,not sign10,075 (+/- a,not sign9,891) (methotrexate monotherapy) to a,not sign39,459 (+/- a,not sign21,149) (platinum + 5FU + cetuximab).

In this study, we used multistate statistical modeling to inform a microsimulation model for cost-effectiveness analysis of individualized radiotherapy in lung cancer. The model tracks clinical events over time and takes patient and tumor features into account. Four clinical states were included in the model: alive without progression, local recurrence, metastasis, and death. Individual patients were simulated by repeatedly sampling a patient profile, consisting of patient and tumor characteristics. The transitioning of patients between the health states is governed by personalized time-dependent hazard rates, which were obtained from multistate statistical modeling (MSSM). The model simulations for both the individualized and conventional radiotherapy strategies demonstrated internal and external validity. Therefore, MSSM is a useful technique for obtaining the correlated individualized transition rates that are required for the quantification of a microsimulation model. Moreover, we have used the hazard ratios, their 95% confidence intervals, and their covariance to quantify the parameter uncertainty of the model in a correlated way. The obtained model will be used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of individualized radiotherapy treatment planning, including the uncertainty of input parameters. We discuss the model-building process and the strengths and weaknesses of using MSSM in a microsimulation model for individualized radiotherapy in lung cancer.",decision making,Medical Informatics

A prospective study started in the Drenthe region of Netherlands. Participants in the study concerning quality of care and quality of life were additionally invited to use the platform. Results. 633 patients were registered after they opted for platform use. Of these patients, 361 (57.0%) never logged on, 184 (29.1%) were labeled ""curious"" users, and 88 (13.9%) were identified as ""active"" users. Users had lower HbA1c levels and more often hypertension compared to nonusers, and reported higher quality of life, better well-being, lower diabetes-related distress, and better medication adherence. Discussion. Platform use was associated with more favorable clinical and psychological characteristics relative to nonuse. Those with greater severity of disease, lower mood, and progression of disease used the platform the least. Other approaches need to be developed to reach these patients.

For these mechanisms to work, robust competition policy needs to be enacted and enforced. We compare the hospital markets in Germany, the Netherlands and England regarding their experience with competition and put a special focus on merger control and the stringency of its implementation. Elaborating on the differences in merger control practice we find that despite very similar goals the respective agencies apply very different approaches and take fundamentally different routes when balancing proclaimed benefits of mergers with potential risks of consolidated markets. While the German competition authority has a strong focus on maintaining the preconditions for competition, in the Netherlands we find over the past decade a much stronger focus on hypothesized countervailing buyer power, accepting in turn highly concentrated markets. In England we find the currently most comprehensive analysis of proposed mergers in combination with a clearly positive assessment of the effects of patient choice and competition on prices and quality. All agencies are still reluctant to implement merger simulation models or similarly advanced econometric methods in their appraisal. One very likely reason is a lack of country specific empirical evidence on these matters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",International comparison,Health Care Sciences & Services

The ABC scale is part of the ABC tool that visualises the outcomes of the questionnaire. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and construct validity of the ABC scale. This multi-centre survey study was conducted in the practices of 19 general practitioners and 9 pulmonologists throughout the Netherlands. Next to the ABC scale, patients with COPD completed the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Reliability analyses were performed with data from 162 cases. Cronbach's alpha was 0.91 for the total scale. Test-retest reliability, measured at a two week interval (n = 137), had an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.92. Analyses for convergent validity were performed with data from 133 cases. Discriminant and known-groups validity was analysed with data from 162 cases. The ABC scale total score had a strong correlation with the total score of the SGRQ (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) but a weak correlation with the forced expired volume in 1 second predicted (r = -0.28, p < 0.001). Subgroups with more severe disease, defined by GOLD-stage, frequency of exacerbations, activity level and depression scored statistically significantly (p < 0.05) worse on almost all domains of the ABC scale than the less severe subgroups.

A co-productive relationship refers to productive patient professional interaction or shared decision making This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014 among 411 patients (out of 981) enrolled in the Dutch COPD care program Kennemer Lucht and 62 professionals treating them (out of 97). Kennemer Lucht COPD involved multicomponent interventions within all six dimensions of the chronic care model (organizational support, conununity, self-management, decision support, delivery system design, and information and communications technology) to improve the quality of care for patients with COPD. This approach was expected to improve relational coproduction of care between professionals and patients with COPD and their informal caregivers. Results show clearly that the perceived quality of chronic care delivery is related significantly to productive interaction/relational coproduction of care. The strength of the relationship between perceptions of quality of chronic care and relational coproduction among patients is strong (r=0.5; P <= 0.001) and among professionals moderate (r=0.4; P <= 0.001 relational coproduction with patients and informal caregivers). Furthermore, patients' perceptions of the quality of chronic care were associated with the existence of productive interaction with health care professionals (beta=0.7; P<0.001). The changing nature of chronic care is associated with coproduction of care, leading to the development of more productive relationships between primary care professionals and COPD patients and their informal caregivers.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's submission, the ERG review, and the NICE's subsequent decisions. The ERG reviewed the evidence for clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, as submitted by the manufacturer to the NICE. The ERG searched for relevant additional evidence and validated the manufacturer's decision analytic model to examine the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. Clinical effectiveness was obtained from a three-arm, European, randomized, phase III trial among red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients with low-/intermediate-1-risk del5q31 MDS. The primary endpoint was RBC independence for a parts per thousand yen26 weeks, and was reached by a higher proportion of patients in the lenalidomide 10 and 5 mg groups compared with placebo (56.1 and 42.6 vs 5.9 %, respectively; both p < 0.001). The option of dose adjustments after 16 weeks due to dose-limiting toxicities or lack of response made long-term effectiveness estimates unreliable, e.g. overall survival (OS). The de novo model of the manufacturer included a Markov state-transition cost-utility model implemented in Microsoft Excel. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the manufacturer was A 56,965 pound. The ERG assessment indicated that the modeling structure represented the course of the disease; however, a few errors were identified and some of the input parameters were challenged. In response to the appraisal documentation, the company revised the economic model, which increased the ICER to A 68,125 pound per quality-adjusted life-year. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) did not recommend lenalidomide as a cost-effective treatment. Subsequently, the manufacturer submitted a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) that provided lenalidomide free of charge for patients who remained on treatment after 26 cycles. This PAS improved the ICER to A 25,300 pound, although the AC considered the proportion of patients who received treatment beyond 26 cycles, and hence the ICER, to be uncertain. Nevertheless, the AC accepted a commitment from the manufacturer to publish, once available, data on the proportion of patients eligible for the PAS, and believed this provided reassurance that lenalidomide was a cost-effective treatment for low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS patients.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Multilevel models were used to investigate the association between variation in implementation and change in outcomes. The teams implemented, on average, eight of the 19 interventions, and the specific package of interventions varied widely. Important barriers and facilitators of implementation were (in) sufficient motivation of healthcare provider and patient, the high starting level of COPD care, the small size of the COPD population per team, the mild COPD population, practicalities of the information and communication technology (ICT) system, and hurdles in reimbursement. Level of implementation as measured with our own scale and the ACIC was not associated with health outcomes. A higher level of implementation measured with the PACIC was positively associated with improved self-management capabilities, but this association was not found for other outcomes.

Drawing on four ethnographic case studies of projects in a public-funded innovation program in rehabilitation care in the Netherlands, we challenge some well-known assumptions about innovation that have long inspired traditional understandings of innovation. The findings are based on data derived from observations and interviews with managers, project leaders, and (para) medical professionals involved in the four innovation projects. The results indicate that (1) people often assign other meanings to innovation than mere 'novelty': (2) that innovation usually entails extensive work that also constructs the value of an innovation; and (3) this has major implications for the management of innovation in organizational practice.

These questionnaires comprise many detailed items resulting in lengthy administrations. Objectives: We set out to find the minimal number of items needed to retrieve 80% and 90% of the costs as measured by the Treatment Inventory of Costs in Patients with psychiatric disorders (TIC-P). Methods: The TIC-P is a validated patient-reported outcome measure concerning the utilization of medical care and productivity losses. The present study focused on direct medical costs. We applied data of 7756 TIC-P administrations from three studies in patients with mental health care issues. Items that contribute least to the total cost were eliminated, providing that 80% and 90% of the total cost was retained. Results: Average medical costs per patient were 658 over the last 4 weeks. The distribution of cost was highly skewed, and 5 of the 14 items of the TIC-P accounted for less than 10% of the total costs. The 80% Mini version of the TIC-P required five items: ambulatory services, private practice, day care, general hospital, and psychiatric clinic. The TIC-P Midi 90% inventory required eight items. Both had variance between the three samples in the optimal choice of the items. Conclusions: The number of items of the TIC-P can be reduced considerably while maintaining 80% and 90% of the medical costs estimated by the complete TIC-P. The reduced length makes the questionnaire more suitable for routine outcome monitoring.",short form questionnaires,Health Care Sciences & Services

Objective: The aim of this study was to provide evidence about the (cost-) effectiveness of Dutch DMPs as implemented in daily practice. Methods: We compared the physical activity, smoking status, quality-adjusted life-years, and yearly costs per patient between the most and the least comprehensive DMPs in four disease categories: primary CVR prevention, secondary CVR prevention, both types of CVR prevention, and COPD (N = 1034). Propensity score matching increased comparability between DMPs. A 2-year cost-utility analysis was performed from the health care and societal perspectives. Sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the impact of DMP development and implementation costs on cost-effectiveness. Results: Patients in the most comprehensive DMPs increased their physical activity more (except for primary CVR prevention) and had higher smoking cessation rates. The incremental QALYs ranged from -0.032 to 0.038 across all diseases. From a societal perspective, the most comprehensive DMPs decreased costs in primary CVR prevention (certainty 57%), secondary CVR prevention (certainty 88%), and both types of CVR prevention (certainty 98%). Moreover, the implementation of comprehensive DMPs led to QALY gains in secondary CVR prevention (certainty 92%) and COPD (certainty 69%). Conclusions: The most comprehensive DMPs for CVR and COPD have the potential to be cost saving, effective, or cost-effective compared with the least comprehensive DMPs.

Recent national and international guidelines suggest strict treatment of CVD risk factors in RA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the self-reported adherence to CV prevention strategies in patients with RA.Method: RA patients visiting an outpatient clinic for strict CVD risk management received a validated questionnaire to evaluate adherence to CV prevention strategies. Strict treatment targets were defined and lifestyle recommendations were given following a prespecified protocol. CVD risk was assessed using the SCORE algorithm.Results: In total, 111 questionnaires were returned (response rate of 82%). A high 10-year CVD risk ( 20%) was present in 53%, but only 3% thought they had an increased CVD risk. A total of 53% of patients reported that they follow the doctors' suggestions exactly' and 75% reported finding it easy to follow the suggestions'. Of the 69% of patients who were prescribed lipid- and/or blood pressure-lowering drugs, 90% reported taking all prescribed tablets. The advice to follow a diet was given to 42%, of whom 68% said they followed the advised diet. Physical exercise was advised to 67%, of whom 62% said they performed specific physical exercise on at least 3 days a week.

Successful change management in healthcare aimed at improving practices requires facilitation skills that support teams in attaining the desired change. Developing facilitation skills in nursing students requires formal educational support. A Dutch Regional Care Improvement Program based on a nationwide format of change management in healthcare was designed to act as a Powerful Learning Environment for nursing students developing competencies in facilitating change. This article has two aims: to provide comprehensive insight into the program components and to describe students' learning experiences in developing their facilitation skills. This Dutch Regional Care Improvement Program considers three aspects of a Powerful Learning Environment: self-regulated learning; problem-based learning; and complex, realistic and challenging learning tasks. These three aspects were operationalised in five distinct areas of facilitation: increasing awareness of the need for change; leadership and project management; relationship building and communication; importance of the local context; and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. Over a period of 18 months, 42 nursing students, supported by trained lecturer-coaches, took part in nine improvement teams in our Regional Care Improvement Program, executing activities in all five areas of facilitation. Based on the students' experiences, we propose refinements to various components of this program, aimed at strengthenin the learning environment. There is a need for further detailed empirical research to study the impact this kind of learning environment has on students developing facilitation competencies in healthcare improvement.

Investigating age- and gender-specific trends in quality of life,"Although many countries' populations have experienced increasing life expectancy in recent decades, quality of life (QoL) trends in the general population have yet to be investigated. This paper investigates whether QoL changed for the general Dutch population over the period 2001-2008. A beta regression model was employed to address specific features of the QoL distribution (i.e., boundedness, skewness, and heteroskedasticity), as well non-linear age and time trends. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) was calculated by combining model estimates of mean QoL with mortality rates provided by Statistics Netherlands. Changes in QALE were decomposed into those changes caused by QoL changes and those caused by mortality-rate changes. The results revealed a significant increase in QoL over 2001-2008 for both genders and most ages. For example, QALE for a man/woman aged 20 was found to have increased by 2.3/1.9 healthy years, of which 0.6/0.8 was due to QoL improvements.",QALE,Health Care Sciences & Services

The potentially most worrisome form of risk selection is skimping on the quality of care for underpriced high-cost patients-that is, patients for whom insurers are compensated at a rate lower than the predicted health care expenses of these patients. In this article we draw lessons for the United States from twenty years of experience with health insurance exchanges in Europe, where risk selection is a serious problem. Mistakes by European legislators and inadequate evaluation criteria for risk selection incentives are discussed, as well as strategies to reduce risk selection and the complex trade-off among selection (through quality skimping), efficiency, and affordability. Recommended improvements to the risk-adjustment process in the United States include considering the adoption of risk adjusters used in Europe, investing in the collection of data, using a permanent form of risk sharing, and replacing the current premium ""band"" restrictions with more flexible restrictions.

Methods: Two surveys were conducted with a sample of carers (n = 202) and a sample of noncarers (n = 200). individuals in both groups were asked three questions in which they had to state the minimum monetary compensation they would require (W'I'A) if they had to look after a person described in a hypothetical scenario for one extra hour per day. Furthermore, carers were asked for the compensation they would demand if they had to be in charge of their actual care recipient for one extra hour per day. Results: No significant differences were found between the distributions of carers' and noncarers' WIA values. Overall, respondents' valuations were sensitive to and consistent with their preferences over the tasks to be carried out in the extra hour of informal care. On average, carers required a lower monetary compensation for one extra hour taking care of their loved one (mean/median WTA values (sic)5.2/(sic)4.5) than if they had to devote that time to look after the hypothetical care recipient (mean/median WIA values (sic)64/(sic)5.5). More than half of the carers stated the same value under the two caring situations, which suggests that carers' WIA values were influenced by their own experience providing informal care. Conclusions: Our results show that it is feasible to derive a monetary valuation for informal care from the preferences of noncarers.",willingness to accept,Health Care Sciences & Services

Currently, no consensus exists on the measurement and valuation of productivity losses. Objective: We aimed to develop a standardized instrument for measuring and valuing productivity losses. Methods: A group of researchers with extensive experience in measuring and valuing productivity losses designed an instrument suitable for self-completion, building on preknowledge and evidence on validity. The instrument was designed to cover all domains of productivity losses, thus allowing quantification and valuation of all productivity losses. A feasibility study was performed to check the questionnaire's consistency and intelligibility. Results: The iMTA Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ) includes three modules measuring productivity losses of paid work due to 1) absenteeism and 2) presenteeism and productivity losses related to 3) unpaid work. Questions for measuring absenteeism and presenteeism were derived from existing validated questionnaires. Because validated measures of losses of unpaid work are scarce, the questions of this module were newly developed. To enhance the instrument's feasibility, simple language was used The feasibility study included 195 respondents (response rate 80%) older than 18 years. Seven percent (n = 13) identified problems while filling in the iPCQ including problems with the questionnaire's instructions and routing (n = 6) and wording (n = 2). Five respondents experienced difficulties in estimating the time that would be needed for other people to make up for lost unpaid work. Conclusions: Most modules of the iPCQ are based on validated questions derived from previously available instruments. The instrument is understandable for most of the general public.",unpaid work,Health Care Sciences & Services

Whilst this method and its potential have until recently only been explored within sociology, there are many interesting and promising facets that may render this approach fruitful within the health care field, most notably to questions about the experiential knowledge or 'expertise' of chronically ill patients (and the extent to which different health care professionals are able to understand this experiential knowledge). The Imitation Game can be especially useful because it provides a way to map this experiential knowledge more systematically, without falling in the dual trap of either over-relying on in-depth, but highly specific phenomenological 'insider'-approaches that are hard to generalize, or, alternatively, problematically reducing the rich life-worlds of patients to a set of indicators in a questionnaire. The main focus of this paper is theoretical and conceptual: explaining the Imitation Game method, discussing its usefulness in the health care domain, and exploring the ways in which the approach can be utilized for chronic illness care. The paper presents both a conceptual and empirical exploration of how the Imitation Game method and its underlying theoretical concepts of 'contributory expertise' and 'interactional expertise' can be transferred from the sociological realm to the field of health care, what kinds of insights can be gained from the method, which methodological issues it may raise, and what potentially fruitful research routes can be explored. I argue that the Imitation Game can be thought of as a 'social learning experiment' that simultaneously enables the participants to learn from each other's perspectives, allows researchers to explore exciting new possibilities, and also offers the tools to intervene in the practice that is being studied.",Intervention,Biomedical Social Sciences

There are also clear framing effects, which violate expected utility. Moreover, we observe loss aversion, indicating that subjects give more weight to one group's loss than another group's gain of the same absolute magnitude. We also elicited some information on the effect of the age of the studied group. The amount of inequity aversion is to some extent influenced by the age of the considered patients.

Using Q-methodology, we examined older people's perceptions of the comparative importance of neighbourhood characteristics for ageing in place. Based on the World Health Organization's Global Age-friendly Cities guide, we developed 26 statements about physical and social neighbourhood characteristics. Thirty-two older people in Rotterdam, half of whom were frail, rank-ordered these statements. Q-factor analysis revealed three distinct viewpoints each among frail and non-frail older people. Comparisons within and between groups are discussed. Although both frail and non-frail older people strongly desired a neighbourhood enabling them to age in place, they have divergent views on such a neighbourhood.

In the Netherlands, hospitals receive reimbursement for cetuximab conditional on cost-effectiveness in daily practice. To estimate the real-world incremental cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for radiotherapy + cetuximab over radiotherapy alone in first line treatment of LA SCCHN, a Markov model is constructed with health states ""alive without progression"", ""alive following progression"" and ""death"". Transition probabilities per month are estimated from clinical trial data and retrospectively collected real-world data from two Dutch head and neck cancer treatment centres (2007-2010, n = 141). 5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons are used, without and with discounting (4 % costs, 1.5 % effects) to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Two scenarios explore different assumptions on prognosis of real-world versus trial patients. Adding cetuximab to radiotherapy results in increased costs and health gains in both scenarios and across each of the time horizons. Incremental costs per QALY gained range between a,not sign14,624 and a,not sign38,543 in the base-case. For a willingness to pay of a,not sign80,000 per QALY, the acceptability curves for the different scenarios show probabilities between 0.76 and 0.87 of radiotherapy + cetuximab being cost-effective compared to radiotherapy alone.

The study also examined whether (changes in) health behaviors and self-management abilities predicted quality of life.

Two years later (T1), questionnaires were sent to 4350 patients still participating in DMPs (1722 [40%] respondents). Structured interviews were held with the 18 DMP project leaders. DMP implementation improved patients' health behavior and physical quality of life, but mental quality of life and self-management abilities declined over time. Changes in patients' investment behavior predicted physical quality of life at T1 (P<.001); physical activity, investment behavior (both P<.05), and self-efficacy (P<.01) at T0, and changes in self-efficacy and investment behavior (both P<.001) predicted patients' mental quality of life at T1. The long-term benefits of these DMPs include successful improvement of chronically ill patients' health behaviors and physical quality of life. However, these programs were not able to improve or maintain broader self-management abilities or mental quality of life, highlighting the need to focus on these abilities and overall quality of life.

To ensure high quality, a variety of checklists with different purposes have been developed and implemented enabling assessment of these evaluations. Three of these checklists are most frequently used and are recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews for critical appraisal (Drummond, CHEC and Philips). Every checklist is developed with a different purpose having, for example, a focus on reporting or conducting and on modeling or trial-based evaluations. This review outlines the heterogeneity in choice and implementation of these quality checklists in an incorrect manner. This ultimately results in under- and even possibly overestimation of quality of included economic evaluations. More guidance in selecting correct checklists suiting the purpose of the quality check is therefore of utmost importance. Moreover, it appears that current checklists are lacking detailed disease-specific guidance resulting in models not correctly reflecting disease progression. Therefore, outcomes indicate that the problem of the wide variability of methodological choices is prevalent in some other disease areas too, regardless of the availability of quality checklists.

Although web-based diaries are well-known as a potential self-management tool, reasons that patients use (or do not use) self-management diaries, as well as perceptions and behaviors related to diary use, remain largely unknown. METHODS: Semistructured interviews (n = 30) were conducted with health-care professionals and subjects to understand perceptions and behaviors related to self-management diary use for asthma and COPD in 2 hospitals in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. RESULTS: Subjects in this study used self-management diaries to improve their knowledge of the disease, cope more consciously with their disease, feel in control, and discuss outcomes from the self-management diaries with their health-care professionals. Two subjects reported that they used the self-management diary to cope more effectively with their disease and recognized an exacerbation and acted by adjusting their medications. Both health-care professionals and subjects experienced practical barriers in integrating self-management diaries into their regular practices. Subjects' reasons for nonuse were related to the intervention, the disease, and subject-provider contact. CONCLUSIONS: Health-care professionals should help patients use self-management diaries by collaboratively developing an individual treatment plan and by showing patients how to use the diaries to recognize and act on an exacerbation. Together with the suggestions made for improving the self-management diaries, this will aid in the integration of self-management diaries into regular health-care practice and enhance patients' self-management of their disease.

Patient-oriented strategies to counteract moral hazard are used in all four countries but their impact on efficiency is unclear and crucially depends on their design. Strategies targeted at insurers are much less popular: Belgium and Switzerland have introduced elements of managed competition for some types of long-term care, as has the Netherlands in 2015. As only some elements of managed competition have been introduced, it is unclear whether it improves efficiency. Its effect will depend on the feasibility of setting appropriate financial incentives for insurers using risk equalization and the willingness of governments to provide insurers with instruments to manage long-term care.",risk adjustment,Health Care Sciences & Services

Explanations for this gender gap in self-perceived health may be different in China than in other countries due to the traditional phenomenon of son preference. We examine several possible reasons for the gap using the Chinese SAGE data. We first rule out differential reporting by gender as a possible explanation, exploiting information on anchoring vignettes in eight domains of health functioning. Decomposing the gap in general self-assessed health, we find that about 31% can be explained by socio-demographic factors, most of all by discrimination against women in education in the 20th century. A more complete specification including chronic conditions and health functioning fully explains the remainder of the gap (about 69%). Adding chronic conditions and health functioning also explains at least two thirds of the education contribution, suggesting how education may affect health. In particular, women's higher rates of arthritis, angina and eye diseases make the largest contributions to the gender health gap, by limiting mobility, increasing pain and discomfort, and causing sleep problems and a feeling of low energy.

We therefore determined hospital resource use and costs of ischemic stroke and TIA in the Netherlands for 2012.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cost analysis using individual patient data from a national diagnosis-related group registry. We analyzed 4 subgroups: inpatient ischemic stroke, inpatient TIA, outpatient ischemic stroke, and outpatient TIA. Costs of carotid endarterectomy and costs of an extra follow-up visit were also estimated. Unit costs were based on reference prices from the Dutch Healthcare Insurance Board and tariffs provided by the Dutch Healthcare Authority. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the association between hospital costs and various patient and hospital characteristics.Results:A total of 35,903 ischemic stroke and 21,653 TIA patients were included. Inpatient costs were Euro5,328 ($6,845) for ischemic stroke and Euro2,470 ($3,173) for TIA. Outpatient costs were Euro495 ($636) for ischemic stroke and Euro587 ($754) for TIA. Costs of carotid endarterectomy were Euro6,836 ($8,783). Costs of inpatient days were the largest contributor to hospital costs. Age, hospital type, and region were strongly associated with hospital costs.Conclusions:Hospital costs are higher for inpatients and ischemic strokes compared with outpatients and TIAs, with length of stay (LOS) the most important contributor.

Plans to introduce these incentives by allowing competition among risk bearing LTC insurers are likely to jeopardize universal access. Combining universal access and competition among risk bearing LTC-insurers requires an adequate system of risk adjustment. While risk adjustment is now widely adopted in health insurance, LTC-specific features cause uncertainty about the feasibility of risk adjustment for LTC insurance. We examine the feasibility of appropriate risk adjustment in LTC insurance by using a rich set of linked nationwide Dutch administrative data. As expected, prior LTC use and demographic information are found to explain much of the variation in individual LTC expenses. However, we find that prior health care expenditures are also important in reducing predicted losses for subgroups of health care users. Nevertheless, incentives for risk selection against some easily identifiable subgroups persist. Moreover, using prior utilization and expenditure as risk adjusters reduces incentives for efficiency, creating a trade-off between equity and efficiency. To ease this trade-off, data on individuals' underlying needs for LTC are required.",Public insurance,Health Care Sciences & Services

Second, we compare three, instead of two, interview situationsbeing interviewed by (a) a majority member, (b) a co-ethnic, and (c) a non-co-ethnic minority memberas to empirically scrutinize the scope of interviewer effects while disentangling whether they are cross-ethnically accommodating (respondents stress their similarities with the non-co-ethnic interviewer) or ethnically affirming (respondents emphasize their own ethnic identity). Our hypotheses are tested on a sample of 225 Surinamese, Turkish, and Moroccan immigrants in the Netherlands. As expected, no interviewer effects occur regarding being ethnic. Regarding feeling ethnic, however, respondents' identifications in the interviewer situation with a majority member vis-a-vis those in both other situations reveal an accommodating interviewer effect.",interviewer effects,Psychology

There is, however, a lack of practical guidance on how to conduct an economic evaluation based on registry data and how this evidence can be used in actual decision making. This paper explains the required steps on how to perform a sound economic evaluation using examples from an economic evaluation conducted with real-world data from the Dutch Population based HAematological Registry for Observational Studies. There are three main issues related to using registry data: confounding by indication, missing data, and insufficient numbers of (comparable) patients. If encountered, it is crucial to accurately deal with these issues to maximize the internal validity and generalizability of the outcomes and their value to decision makers. Multivariate regression modeling, propensity score matching, and data synthesis are well-established methods to deal with confounding. Multiple imputation methods should be used in cases where data are missing at random. Furthermore, it is important to base the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a new treatment compared with its alternative on comparable groups of (matched) patients, even if matching results in a small analytical population. Unmatched real-world data provide insights into the costs and effects of a treatment in a real-world setting. Decision makers should realize that real-world evidence provides extremely valuable and relevant policy information, but needs to be assessed differently compared with evidence derived from a randomized clinical trial.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Subjects (n= 1943) were primary school children around the age of 8-9 years old and their primary caregivers: native Dutch children (n = 1546), Turkish children (n = 93), Moroccan children (n = 66), other non-western children (n = 105), and other western children (n = 133).

Main explanatory variables were physical activity, dietary intake, and sleep duration. We controlled for age, sex, parental educational level, and parental BMI. Although sleep duration, dietary intake of fruit, and dietary intake of energy-dense snacks were associated with BMI, ethnic differences in sleep duration and dietary intake did not have a large impact on ethnic differences in overweight and obesity among children from migrant and native origin. It is suggested that future preventive strategies to reduce overweight and obesity, in general, consider the role of sleep duration. Also, cross-cultural variation in preparation of food among specific migrant groups, focusing on fat, sugar, and salt, deserves more attention.

The Dutch Health Inspectorate initiated a mystery guest pilot project in elderly care as a response to political and social pressure. An independent evaluation of this project revealed that the primary goal of this approach - to provide a better view of the exigencies of daily practice in elderly care - was not met. Inspectors did not use the information delivered by the mystery guests because how they evaluated quality and reported findings did not align with practices used by the health inspectorate. Additionally, the inspectors felt that other instruments being developed were more appropriate for providing a better view of practice. While political pressure is important for effecting change in general, the specific instruments to be used for formal supervision of health institutions should be developed and implemented within the organization in accordance with existing standards and approaches. The choice to implement a new supervision instrument, including sending mystery guests into care institutions, should be preceded by an ethical analysis that takes into account the specific context of its use.

THE INFLUENCE OF PUBLIC LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE","International differences in long-term care (LTC) use are well documented, but not well understood. Using comparable data from two countries with universal public LTC insurance, the Netherlands and Germany, we examine how institutional differences relate to differences in the choice for informal and formal LTC. Although the overall LTC utilization rate is similar in both countries, use of formal care is more prevalent in the Netherlands and informal care use in Germany. Decomposition of the between-country differences in formal and informal LTC use reveals that these differences are not chiefly the result of differences in population characteristics but mainly derive from differences in the effects of these characteristics that are associated with between-country institutional differences. These findings demonstrate that system features such as eligibility rules and coverage generosity and, indirectly, social preferences can influence the choice between formal and informal care. Less comprehensive coverage also has equity implications: for the poor, access to formal LTC is more difficult in Germany than in the Netherlands.

Real-world studies involve evaluating the effects and costs of treatments in daily clinical practice. This study reports on the real-world resource use and costs of adjuvant treatments of stage III colon cancer in a population-based observational study. Analyses were based on a detailed retrospective medical chart review which was conducted for 206 patients with colon cancer treated in 2005 and 2006 in the Netherlands. Mean total costs per patient were Euro9681 for 5-FU/LV, Euro9736 for capecitabine, Euro32793 for FOLFOX and Euro18361 for CAPOX. Drug costs and the costs related to hospitalisations for chemotherapy administration were the main cost drivers. We identified a potential for substantial cost-savings when the 48h administration of 5FU/LV in the FOLFOX regimen were to take place in an outpatient setting or be replaced by oral capecitabine as in the CAPOX regimen.

In the Dutch mandatory basic health insurance however, only 11 per cent of the insured opted for a VD in 2014. Several determinants could affect the decision to opt for a VD. This paper examines one of these determinants: the financial profitability. A VD is profitable for the consumer if the out-of-pocket expenses do not exceed the offered premium rebate. The empirical analyses, based upon individual-level data on costs and characteristics of over 800,000 Dutch insured, show that a VD of 500 on top of the mandatory deductible of 360 would have been financially profitable for 48 per cent of the Dutch insured given the average premium rebate of (sic) 240 in 2014. If the whole population had a VD, most insured would obtain either the maximum loss (44. per cent) or the maximum gain (41 per cent). A VD is profitable for males, young insured, healthy insured and insured with few healthcare expenses in the past. To further reduce moral hazard, the following strategies can be used to increase the number of insured opting for a VD: provide insured with information regarding the VD and introduce a shifted deductible.

Consumers will switch insurer if their perceived switching benefits outweigh their perceived switching costs. We developed a conceptual framework with potential switching benefits and costs in competitive health insurance markets. Moreover, we used a questionnaire among Dutch consumers (1091 respondents) to empirically examine the relevance of the different switching benefits and costs in consumers' decision to (not) switch insurer. Price, insurers' service quality, insurers' contracted provider network, the benefits of supplementary insurance, and welcome gifts are potential switching benefits. Transaction costs, learning costs, 'benefit loss' costs, uncertainty costs, the costs of (not) switching provider, and sunk costs are potential switching costs. In 2013 most Dutch consumers switched insurer because of (1) price and (2) benefits of supplementary insurance. Nearly half of the non-switchers - and particularly unhealthy consumers - mentioned one of the switching costs as their main reason for not switching. Because unhealthy consumers feel not free to easily switch insurer, insurers have reduced incentives to invest in high-quality care for them. Therefore, policymakers should develop strategies to increase consumer choice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Switching benefits,Health Care Sciences & Services

For this reason, alternative preference-based instruments have been developed for economic evaluations in the elderly, such as the ICECAP-O. The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness using a short run time frame for an integrated care model for frail elderly, and (2) to investigate whether using a broader measure of (capability) wellbeing in an economic evaluation leads to a different outcome in terms of cost-effectiveness. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses on costs and outcomes separately. We also performed incremental net monetary benefit regressions using quality adjusted life years (QALYs) based on the ICECAP-O and EQ-5D. In terms of QALYs as measured with the EQ-5D and the ICECAP-O, there were small and insignificant differences between the instruments, due to negligible effect size. Therefore, widespread implementation of the Walcheren integrated care model would be premature based on these results. All results suggest that, using the ICECAP-O, the intervention has a higher probability of cost-effectiveness than with the EQ-5D at the same level of WTP. In case an intervention's health and wellbeing effects are not significant, as in this study, using the ICECAP-O will not lead to a false claim of cost-effectiveness of the intervention. On the other hand, if differences in capability QALYs are meaningful and significant, the ICECAP-O may have the potential to measure broader outcomes and be more sensitive to differences between intervention and comparators.",ICECAP-O,Health Care Sciences & Services

Included studies assessed the number of patients who were admitted to hospital due to an ADR, studies that assessed the number of patients who developed an ADR during hospitalization, and studies that measured ADRs in the outpatient setting. In total, 47 articles were included in the final review. The median percentage of hospital admissions due to an ADR was 3.5 %, based on 22 studies, and the median percentage of patients who experienced an ADR during hospitalization was 10.1 %, based on 13 studies. Only five studies were found that assessed ADRs occurring in the outpatient setting. These results indicate that the occurrence of ADRs in the European hospital setting-both ADRs that result in hospitalization and ADRs that occur during the hospital stay-is significant.

Choices have to be made, and health economics can help in allocating limited health-care resources among unlimited wants and needs. Attempts to achieve cost reductions often focus on severe pathologies and chronic diseases as they commonly represent high health-care expenditures. In this context, awareness of the considerable financial burden caused by disease-related malnutrition (DRM) is lacking. Possibilities of reducing costs by optimising the management of DRM through medical nutrition will mostly not even be taken into account. During a European expert meeting, the total evaluation of medical nutrition was viewed and discussed. The aim of this meeting was to gain an experts' outline of the key issues relating to the health economic assessment of the use of medical nutrition.

A Taxonomy and Review of Measures-of-Fit for Risk-Equalization Models,"This study provides a taxonomy of measures-of-fit that have been used for evaluating risk-equalization models since 2000 and discusses important properties of these measures, including variations in analytic method. It is important to consider the properties of measures-of-fit and variations in analytic method, because they influence the outcomes of evaluations that eventually serve as a basis for policymaking. Analysis of 81 eligible studies resulted in the identification of 71 unique measures that were divided into 3 categories based on treatment of the prediction error: measured based on squared errors, untransformed errors, and absolute errors. We conclude that no single measure-of-fit is best across situations. The choice of a measure depends on preferences about the treatment of the prediction error and the analytic method. If the objective is measuring financial incentives for risk selection, the only adequate evaluation method is to assess the predictive performance for non-random groups.",predictive performance,Health Care Sciences & Services

The primary dataset comprised 1,020,749 singleton hospital births from a parts per thousand yen22 weeks' gestation (The Netherlands Perinatal Registry 2000-2008). PARs for single and grouped risk factors were estimated in four stages: (1) creating a duplicate dataset for each PAR analysis in which risk factors of interest were set to the most favorable value (e.g., all women assigned 'Western' for PAR calculation of ethnicity); (2) in the primary dataset an elaborate multilevel logistic regression model was fitted from which (3) the obtained coefficients were used to predict perinatal mortality in each duplicate dataset; (4) PARs were then estimated as the proportional change of predicted- compared to observed perinatal mortality. Additionally, PARs for grouped risk factors were estimated by using sequential values in two orders: after PAR estimation of grouped maternal risk factors, the resulting PARs for grouped child, and grouped organizational factors were estimated, and vice versa. The combined PAR of maternal, child and organizational factors is 94.4 %, i.e., when all factors are set to the most favorable value perinatal mortality is expected to be reduced with 94.4 %. Depending on the order of analysis, the PAR of maternal risk factors varies from 1.4 to 13.1 %, and for child- and organizational factors 58.7-74.0 and 7.3-34.3 %, respectively.

By using health survey data on QoL for the general Dutch population linked to the mortality registry, we quantify the magnitude of this relationship. For addressing specific features of the nonstandard QoL distribution such as boundness, skewness, and heteroscedasticity, we modeled QoL using a generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) with a inflated outcome distribution. Our empirical results indicate that QoL decreases when approaching death, suggesting that there is a strong relationship between TTD and QoL. Predictions of different regression models revealed that ignoring this relationship results in an underestimation of the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for preventive interventions. The underestimation ranged between 3% and 7% and depended on age, the number of years gained from the intervention, and the discount rate used.",inflated distribution,Medical Informatics

Methods A 1-year longitudinal study with employed persons aged 45-64 was conducted within the Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (n = 8,837). Using an online questionnaire, work-related factors (physical: physical load; psychosocial: psychological job demands, autonomy, and support) and work engagement were measured at baseline and health at baseline and 1-year follow-up. General linear models were used to assess associations of work-related factors and work engagement with health. Tests of interaction terms assessed whether work engagement buffered the work-related factor-health associations. Results Unfavourable psychosocial work-related factors at baseline were associated with poorer mental health at follow-up. Higher physical load, higher psychological job demands, and lower autonomy at baseline were associated with poorer physical health at follow-up. Higher work engagement at baseline was related to better physical and especially better mental health during the 1-year follow-up. Work engagement had a small effect on the associations between work-related factors and health. Conclusions Among older employees, especially the promotion of a high work engagement and, to a lesser extent, favourable work-related factors can be beneficial for mental health in particular.",Sustainable employability,Social Issues

Organizational influences either encroach on professional work or professionals resist change and evade organizational rules. Increasingly however, this dualistic view is supplemented with the perspective of organized professionalism, which focuses on the negotiated and reciprocal relationship between organizational and professional logics. In this perspective, professionals increasingly engage in new organizational issues and incorporate those into their professional work. We build on these insights, but take the debate on organized professionalism one step further. Using the sociological concept of articulation work, we show that organizational tasks are not always 'new', but can be inherent to professionalism. In a study of Dutch neighbourhood nurses (NNs), we find three types of articulation work: intraprofessional, interprofessional, and lay articulation work. NNs perform articulation work to provide and organize care at the same time. They integrate taylorized home care services, coordinate the work of different professionals, and stimulate informal care. We conclude that articulation work traditionally lies at the heart of professionalism, but is not static and acquires new meaning because of changing organizational conditions and policy reforms.",division of labor,Sociology

Consequently, insurers face incentives for risk rating and risk selection, both of which jeopardize affordability of coverage, accessibility to health care, and quality of care. This study explores to what extent the predictive performance of the prediction model used in risk equalization can be improved by using additional administrative information on costs and diagnoses from three prior years. We analyze data from 13.8 million individuals in the Netherlands in the period 2006-2009. First, we show that there is potential for improving models' predictive performance at both the population and subgroup level by extending them with risk adjusters based on cost and/or diagnostic information from multiple prior years. Second, we show that even these extended models do not adequately compensate insurers. By using these extended models incentives for risk rating and risk selection can be reduced substantially but not removed completely. The extent to which risk-equalization models can be improved in practice may differ across countries, depending on the availability of data, the method chosen to calculate risk-adjusted payments, the value judgment by the regulator about risk factors for which the model should and should not compensate insurers, and the trade-off between risk selection and efficiency.",Predictive performance,Health Care Sciences & Services

These data enable us to analyze health policy issues over time and in comparison with other countries. However, current official Belgian estimates of private expenditure (as published in the OECD Health Data) have proven not to be reliable. We distinguish four potential major sources of problems with estimating private health spending: interpretation of definitions, formulation of assumptions, missing or incomplete data and incorrect data. Using alternative sources of billing information, we have reached more accurate estimates of private and out-of-pocket expenditure. For Belgium we found differences of more than 100% between our estimates and the official Belgian estimates of private health expenditure (as published in the OECD Health Data). For instance, according to OECD Health Data private expenditure on hospitals in Belgium amounts to (sic)3.1 billion, while according to our alternative calculations these expenses represent only (sic)1.1 billion. Total private expenditure differs only 1%, but this is a mere coincidence. This exercise may be of interest to other OECD countries looking to improve their estimates of private expenditure on health. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In the Netherlands, rates of institutional LTC use are falling, whereas homecare use is growing. Are these changes attributable to declining disability rates, or has LTC use given disability changed? And have institutionalization rates fallen regardless of disability level, or has LTC use become better tailored to needs? We answer these questions by explaining trends in LTC use for the Dutch 65+ population in the period 2000-2008 using a nonlinear variant of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. We find that changes in LTC use are not due to shifts in the disability distribution but can almost entirely be traced back to changes in the way the system treats disability. Elderly with mild disability are more likely to be treated at home than before, whereas severely disabled individuals continue to receive institutional LTC. As a result, LTC use has become better tailored to the needs for such care. This finding suggests that policies that promote LTC in the community rather than in institutions can effectively mitigate the consequences of population aging on LTC spending.

Methods: We used data from three clinical trials (the Randomized Clinical Trial on Effectiveness of Integrated COPD Management in Primary Care [RECODE], the Assessment Of Going Home Under Early Assisted Discharge [GO-AHEAD], and the Health Status Guided COPD Care [MARCH]). Data were randomly split into an estimation sample and a validation sample. The conceptual similarity between patient-reported CCQ and preference based EQ-5D scores was assessed using correlation and principal-component analysis. Different types of models were estimated with increasing complexity. We selected the final models on the basis of mean absolute error and root mean square error when comparing predicted and observed values from the same population (internal validity) and from different trial populations (external validity). We also developed models for different country-specific EQ-5D value sets. Results: The principal-component analysis showed that the CCQ domains functional state and mental state are associated with four dimensions of the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D dimension pain/ discomfort formed a separate construct on which no CCQ item loaded. The mean observed EQ-5D values were not significantly different from the mean predicted EQ-5D values in internal validation samples but did significantly differ in external validation samples. The models underestimated EQ-5D values in milder health states and overestimated them in more severe health states. The predictive ability of the models was similar across different EQ-5D value sets. Conclusions: The models can predict mean EQ-5D values that are similar to observed mean values in a similar population. the overestimating/underestimating of the low/high EQ-5D values, however, limits its use in Markov models.

Data were retrospectively collected from patients included in the pivotal Assessment of Proteasome Inhibition for Extending Remissions trial (APEX; n =333)and two groups of daily practice patients treated with bortezomib following progression from upfront therapy (n=201): real-world patients treated as of May 2009 (RW-1; n = 72) and June 2012 (RW-2; n = 129). Prognosis, treatment, and effectiveness were compared. Outcomes research was useful for policymakers for addressing to whom and how bortezomib was administered in daily practice. It was limited however in generating robust evidence on real-world safety and effectiveness. The quality of real-world evidence on effectiveness was low due to missing data in patient charts, existing treatment variation and the dynamics in care during the novel drug's initial market uptake period.

We conducted a case study on governance and regulation of quality and safety in Dutch hospitals to reveal these processes. We found that governance was given meaning in several phases, ranging from a focus on institutional design (e.g. corporate governance) through coping with incidents and using quality measurements, to prospective risk management. Governance changed incrementally in form and practice. We also saw that governance and regulation are intertwined; regulation shapes governance and is simultaneously shaped by changes in the meaning of governance. Insight into these processes is important to better understand what is defined as ""good governance"" and ""good regulation"" in a certain context. Understanding the mutual development of these concepts and practices reveals potential pathways to continuous shaping of good governance.",regulation,Health Care Sciences & Services

A Systematic Review of Inclusion and Impact of Informal Care in Cost-Effectiveness Studies,"Conclusion Most economic evaluations in the area of Alzheimer's disease include costs and/or effects related to informal caregiving. However, in other disease areas where informal caregiving is common it seems that the majority of economic evaluations ignore informal caregiving. The inclusion of informal care can have a strong impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes. Future economic evaluations should therefore consider the relevance of informal care in the context of their study, and either include these costs and effects or justify why they were excluded.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Based on the rationale that there are important lessons to be learnt from mistakes and that insights into critical incidents will help to prevent them from happening again, there is a widespread assumption that conducting inquiries will contribute to improvements in patient safety. In this article, we draw on data from a qualitative comparative case study of three critical incidents in Dutch hospitals in the last decade to examine the ways in which critical incidents are investigated. Through a detailed analysis of the inquiry documentation, we identified four key elements in the inquiry process: how risks were framed and perceived, the type of methods the inquiries used to examine critical incidents, the ways in which inquiries allocated blame and the ways in which they sought to maintain transparency. Drawing on Schon and Rein's work on framing theory, in this article we examined how the key participants in the inquiries framed issues so that they could undertake their work. We found that inquiries are complex processes in which inquiry teams can and do use different frames for deciding who should be involved in the inquiry, what should be discussed, how this should be done and to whom findings of the inquiry should be disclosed. We found that inquiries used professional, managerial or governance frames and sometimes elements of two or more frames coexisted. Within these frames, risk was framed in different ways, leading to different types of actions, involving different groups of actors.",inquiries,Biomedical Social Sciences

During the research the original focus on paediatric HIV care shifted to HIV care in general in reaction to participant responses. Participants identified three main barriers to positive church engagement in HIV care: (a) stigma and disclosure; (b) sexual associations with HIV and (c) religious beliefs and practices. All participant groups appreciated the opportunity and relevance of strengthening church involvement in HIV care. Opportunities for positive church engagement in HIV care that participants identified included: (a) comprehensive and holistic HIV care when churches and clinics collaborate; (b) the wide social reach of churches and (c) the safety and acceptance in churches.

However, we found that current rules for setting ACO spending targets (or benchmarks) diminish ACOs' incentives to generate savings and may even encourage higher instead of lower Medicare spending. Spending in the three years before ACOs enter or renew a contract is weighted unequally in the benchmark calculation, with a high weight of 0.6 given to the year just before a new contract starts. Thus, ACOs have incentives to increase spending in that year to inflate their benchmark for future years and thereby make it easier to obtain shared savings from Medicare in the new contract period. We suggest strategies to improve incentives for ACOs, including changes to the weights used to determine benchmarks and new payment models that base an ACO's spending target not only on its own past performance but also on the performance of other ACOs or Medicare providers.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

A decision-analytic Markov cohort model with three health states and 1-month cycle time was developed and run within a life time horizon. Data from two multinational, prospective, open-label Phase 3 studies were used to assess patients' survival. While utilities were generalized from UK data, local resource utilization and disease-associated treatment, hospitalization, and side effect costs were applied. The alternative scenario was performed to assess the impact of lower life expectancy of the general population in Ukraine on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for treatment-naive patients. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. The ICER (in US dollars) of treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with FCR versus FC is US$8,704 per quality-adjusted life year gained for treatment-naive patients and US$11,056 for refractory/relapsed patients. When survival data were modified to the lower life expectancy of the general population in Ukraine, the ICER for treatment-naive patients was higher than US$13,000. This value is higher than three times the current gross domestic product per capita in Ukraine. Sensitivity analyses have shown a high impact of rituximab costs and a moderate impact of differences in utilities on the ICER. Furthermore, probabilistic sensitivity analyses have shown that for refractory/relapsed patients the probability of FCR being cost-effective is higher than for treatment-naive patients and is close to one if the threshold is higher than US$15,000. State coverage of rituximab treatment may be considered a cost-effective treatment for the Ukrainian population under conditions of economic stability, cost-effectiveness threshold growth, or rituximab price negotiations.",Ukraine,Oncology

This paper presents a first explorative study on positional concerns in the context of health. Using a 'two-world' survey method, a convenience sample of 143 people chose between two options (having more in absolute terms or having more in relative terms) in several health and non-health domains. Our results for the non-health domains compare reasonably well to previous studies, with 22-47 % of respondents preferring the positional option. In the health domain, these percentages were significantly lower, indicating a stronger focus on absolute positions.

Methods: A nation-wide available, free, web-based, self-reported questionnaire for pre-conception use (in Dutch). Between May 2006 and August 2009, 89,946 questionnaires were completed (78,732 were from unique respondents) and available for research purposes, from which those of non-pregnant women (n = 66,617) were selected. Socio-demographic subgroups were distinguished by age, ethnicity, urban living area and living in a deprived neighbourhood. The four pre-conception risk domains were lifestyle, medical, reproductive and family history; together they were defining the risk profile. X-2 tests were used to compare the risk profiles among the subgroups. Results: The prevalences of the reported risk factors are given. The risk factor profiles revealed that the average, responding, nonpregnant, Dutch woman is exposed to a substantial number of risk factors. Different risk profiles were observed in the different socio-demographic subgroups. Women older than 36 years, of non-Western origin, living in urban areas and those in deprived neighbourhoods showed higher risk profiles, based on a larger number of risks, with significantly higher prevalences. Conclusion: Self-reported data from a large, self-selected, non-pregnant population who actively visited a web-site for reproductive information suggest the need for active general pre-conception care as risk factors were abundant. A considerable increase in attention for pre-conception care is justified; different subpopulations most likely require adapted approaches. (C) 2015 S.

The Device Module monitors the safety status of OR devices and the Patient Module tracks the patients' locations during their hospital stay. The PD principles 'multidisciplinary team', 'participation users (active involvement)' and 'early adopters' were used to include users from the RFID company, the university and the hospital. The design and implementation process consisted of two 'structured cycles' ('iterations'). The effectiveness of this approach was assessed by the acceptance in terms of level of use, continuity of the project and purchase. The Device Module included eight strategic and twelve tactical actions and the Patient Module included six strategic and twelve tactical actions. Both modules are now used on a daily basis and are purchased by the hospitals for continued use. The RFID specific PD approach was effective in guiding and supporting the design and implementation process of RFID technology in the OR. The multidisciplinary teams and their active participation provided insights in the social and the organizational context of the hospitals making it possible to better fit the technology to the hospitals' (future) needs.",Critical success factors,Medical Informatics

Consequently, many patients live with ambiguous genitalia and appearance. We compared reported outcomes on body image, sexual functioning, and sexual orientation of 39 adults with DSDs (aged 18 to 41) and 39 healthy controls matched for gender, age, and residential setting (urban, suburban, rural). Differences in gender and treatment status (treated or untreated) were also explored. On body image, adults with DSDs reported dissatisfaction with sex-related body parts. Compared to the matched controls, women with DSDs reported greater sexual distress, and men with DSDs reported lower erectile and ejaculation frequencies, and more dissatisfaction with sexual life but not with sexual desire and activities. Men with DSDs who had undergone genital surgery reported higher erectile and ejaculation frequencies than untreated men. More women than men in the DSDs group reported a nonexclusive heterosexual orientation. DSDs and infertility had a great impact on sexuality. Fear of ostracism complicated DSD acceptance. Findings were compared to those of Western studies. Based on these results, education about DSDs and their psychosexual consequences may help reduce the sexual distress and problems in adults with DSDs and improve quality of life.",,Social Sciences - Other Topics

This study created algorithms for mapping clinical and behavioral measures for children with ASDs to health utility scores. The algorithms could be useful for estimating the value of different interventions and treatments used in the care of children with ASDs. Participants were recruited from two Autism Treatment Network sites. Health utility data based on the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) for the child were obtained from the primary caregiver (proxy-reported) through a survey (N=224). During the initial clinic visit, proxy-reported measures of the Child Behavior Checklist, Vineland II Adaptive Behavior Scales, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (start measures) were obtained and then merged with the survey data. Nine mapping algorithms were developed using the HUI3 scores as dependent variables in ordinary least squares regressions along with the start measures, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, to measure severity, child age, and cognitive ability as independent predictors. In-sample cross-validation was conducted to evaluate predictive accuracy. Multiple imputation techniques were used for missing data. The average age for children with ASDs in this study was 8.4 (standard deviation=3.5) years. Almost half of the children (47%) had cognitive impairment (IQ70). Total scores for all of the outcome measures were significantly associated with the HUI3 score. The algorithms can be applied to clinical studies containing start measures of children with ASDs to predict QALYs gained from interventions.

A necessary condition for competition among hospitals is that patients do not automatically choose the nearest hospital, but are-at least to some extent-sensitive to differences in hospital quality. In this study, an analysis is performed on the underlying features of patient hospital choice in a setting where prices do not matter for patients as a result of health insurance coverage. Using claims data from all Dutch hospitals over the years 2008-2010, a conditional logit model examines the relationship between patient characteristics (age, gender and reoperations) and hospital attributes (hospital quality information, waiting times on treatments and travel time for patients to the hospitals) in the market for general non-emergency hip replacement treatments. The results show that travel time is the most important determinant in patient hospital choice. From our analysis, however, it follows that publicly available hospital quality ratings and waiting times also have a significant impact on patient hospital choice. The panel data used for this study (2008-2010) is rather short, which may explain why no coherent and persistent changes in patient hospital choice behaviour over time are found.",Time variation,Health Care Sciences & Services

We examine what drives uptake, the degree of inclusive practices of the schemes and the influence of health status on enrolment. The most important finding is that a household's socio-economic status does not appear to substantially inhibit uptake. In some cases scheduled caste/scheduled tribe households are more likely to enrol. Second, households with greater financial liabilities find insurance more attractive. Third, access to the national hospital insurance scheme Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana does not dampen CBHI uptake, suggesting that the potential for greater development of insurance markets and products beyond existing ones would respond to a need. Fourth, recent episodes of illness and self-assessed health status do not influence uptake. Fifth, insurance coverage is prioritized within households, with the household head, the spouse of the household head and both male and female children of the household head, more likely to be insured as compared with other relatives. Sixth, offering insurance through women's SHGs appears to mitigate concerns about the inclusiveness and sustainability of CBHI schemes.

The challenge is to go beyond the simple application of LM&SS and to develop a climate of continuous improvement.

Women were consecutively screened with M2C and R4U. For referral to tailored care based on specific PPS risks, inter-test agreement of single risks was performed in terms of overall accuracy and positive accuracy (risk present according to both instruments). With univariate regression analysis we explored determinants of poor agreement (<90 %). For triage based on risk accumulation and for detecting women-at-risk for adverse birth outcomes, M2C and R4U sum scores were compared. Overall accuracy of single risks was high (mean 93 %). Positive accuracy was lower (mean 46 %) with poorest accuracy for current psychiatric symptoms. Educational level and ethnicity partly explained poor accuracy (p < 0.05). Overall low PPS prevalence decreased the statistical power. For triage, M2C and R4U sum scores were interchangeable from sum scores of five or more (difference <1 %). The probability of adverse birth outcomes similarly increased with risk accumulation for both instruments, identifying 55-75 % of women-at-risk. The self-report M2C and the professional's R4U checklist seem interchangeable for triage of women-at-risk for PPS or adverse birth outcomes.

We used the concept 'affordances' as a conceptual-analytic tool to refer to the perceived promises, symbolic meanings, and utility values of an innovation constructed in the wider social context of use. This concept helps us empirically understand robot adoption. Data from 28 in-depth interviews with diverse purposively-sampled stakeholders, and from medical literature, policy documents, Health Technology Assessment reports, congress websites and patients' weblogs/forums between April 2009 and February 2014 were systematically analysed from the perspective of affordances. We distinguished five interrelated affordances of the robot that accounted for shaping and fulfilling its rapid adoption: 'characteristics-related' affordances such as smart nomenclature and novelty, symbolising high-tech clinical excellence; 'research-related' affordances offering medical-technical scientific excellence; 'entrepreneurship-related' affordances for performing better-than-the-competition; 'policy-related' affordances indicating the robot's liberalised provision and its reduced financial risks; and 'communication-related' affordances of the robot in shaping patients' choices and the public's expectations by resonating promising discourses while pushing uncertainties into the background. These affordances make the take-up and use of the da Vinci robot sound perfectly rational and inevitable. This Dutch case study demonstrates the fruitfulness of the affordances approach to empirically capturing the contextual dynamics of technology adoption in health care: exploring in-depth actors' interaction with the technology while considering the interpretative spaces created in situations of use. This approach can best elicit real-life value of innovations, values as defined through the eyes of (potential) users. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, supplementary insurance (SI) may restrict choice of insurer for basic health insurance (BI) due to a joint purchase of BI and SI. Roos and Schut (Eur J Health Econ 13(1):51-62, 2012) found that the belief in not being accepted by another insurer for SI was an important reason for not switching insurer for BI for 4 % of the non-switching Dutch population in 2006. This increased to approximately 7 % in 2009. In this paper, we provide evidence that in 2011 and 2012 approximately 10 % of the Dutch population expected that another insurer would not accept them for SI. An additional 20 % of the consumers expected to be accepted by another insurer, but only for a higher premium than other consumers with the same SI. About one-third of the elderly (55+) consumers, and more than half of the consumers with bad or moderate health status, expected their current insurer to offer them more favourable conditions for SI, in terms of acceptance and premium, than other insurers do for similar SI. However, if dissatisfied high-risk consumers, due to a joint purchase of BI and SI, do not switch insurer for BI, the disciplining effect of 'voting with one's feet' is substantially reduced. This is a serious problem that may increase in coming years. We discuss several potential solutions. Our conclusion is that the integration of BI and SI into one basic-plus-insurance is an effective solution under current EU legislation.

Exchanges occur in cycles or in chains in which each agent gives a good to the next agent. Kidney exchange is an important type of barter exchange market that allows incompatible patient-donor pairs to exchange kidneys so the involved patients can receive a transplant. The clearing problem is to find an allocation of donors to patients that is optimal with respect to multiple criteria. To achieve the best possible score on all criteria, long cycles and chains are often needed, particularly when there are many hard-to-match patients. In this paper we show why this may pose difficulties for existing approaches to the optimization of kidney exchanges. We then present a generic iterative branch-and-price algorithm that can deal effectively with multiple criteria, and we show how the pricing problem may be solved in polynomial time for a general class of criteria. Our algorithm is effective even for large, realistic patient-donor pools. Our approach and its effects are demonstrated by using simulations with kidney exchange data from the Netherlands and the United States.",simulation,Operations Research & Management Science

Evidence, however, suggests that individuals differ in their resilience to deal with adverse life-events and protect their well-being. These differences may be explained by an individual's resources such as education, employment, and social support. Studies on how youth with disabilities perceive their well-being and resources important to their well-being are, however, lacking. In this study we therefore compared education, employment, social support, and well-being between youth with disabilities (n = 120) and their peers (n = 117) in South Africa. In addition, we investigated the relationship between background characteristics, having a disability, access to resources, and well-being. The unemployment rate among youth with disabilities is higher, they are less educated, receive less social support and report poorer states of well-being. Our study showed that having a disability, social support, and employment were associated with the well-being of youth in South Africa. While having a disability predicted well-being in youth, the effect was mediated by employment and social support, indicating that those two resources influence wellbeing through both a direct and buffer effect. Therefore, employment and social support may mitigate the negative consequences of a disability and have a substantial role in improving or maintaining well-being.",South Africa,Social Sciences - Other Topics

Claims that more citizens can be heard in more (effective) ways, ultimately bringing society closer to participatory and democratized knowledge production have grown even stronger with the increasing popularity of so-called 'Web 2.0' applications and 'social media'. Such claims seem to suggest that the possibility of making an active contribution automatically leads to everyone having an equal say, where information coming from various sources is given equal consideration. The implications of this suggestion are especially important for fields such as medicine and health care, where expertise is primarily considered to fall under a professional domain that privileges evidence-based knowledge (i.e. developed during randomized controlled trials) as the only 'valid' form of knowledge on which to base practice. In this article, the author examines claims regarding democratization of knowledge production in relation to the practice of crowdsourcing - where tasks such as problem-solving and quality control are 'outsourced' via the Web to specific target groups ('the crowd') - in the specific context of health care. Drawing on a study of the site www.mijnmedicijn.nl ('my medicine'), the author questions how the mediating/knowledge brokering role of such sites influences the nature and structure of the information exchange on the site. How does the information produced via such sites 'fit' with existing information/knowledge hierarchies and infrastructures? How do Web 2.0 sites/applications simultaneously complement/reinforce and challenge traditional forms of knowledge production?",crowdsourcing,Sociology

In the Netherlands, at the level of policy discourse, growing waiting lists are often referred to as a persistent ""shortage"" of organs, producing a ""public health crisis."" In this way, organ donation is presented as an ethical, social, and medical necessity. Likewise, policy discourse offers a range of seemingly unambiguous solutions: improving logistical infrastructure at the level of hospitals, developing organizational and legal protocols, as well as public information campaigns. Instead of taking these problem and solution definitions as given, we critically examine the relationship between policy discourse and clinical practice. Based on a historical review, first, we trace the key moments of transformation where organ donation became naturalized in Dutch policy discourse, particularly in its altruistic connotation. Second, based on in-depth interviews with medical professionals, we show how those involved in organ donation continue to struggle with the controversial nature of their clinical practice. More specifically, we highlight their use of different forms of knowledge that underlie clinicians' ""transition work"": from losing a patient to ""gaining"" a donor.",technology in health care,Biomedical Social Sciences

An empirical study of over 1 million births in the Netherlands,"In this hypothetical analysis with retrospective cohort data (1,160,708 hospital births) we estimated outcome of centralisation of acute obstetric care, i.e., closure of 10 hospitals (out of 99) in The Netherlands. The main outcome was predicted intrapartum and first-week mortality (further referred to as neonatal mortality) for several subgroups of patients affected by two centralisation scenarios: (1) closure of the 10 smallest hospitals; (2) closure of the 10 smallest hospitals, but avoiding adjacent closures. Predictions followed from regression coefficients from a multilevel logistic regression model. Scenario I resulted in doubled travel time, and 10% increased mortality (210 [0.34%] to 231 [0.38%] cases). Scenario 2 showed less effect on mortality (268 [0.33%] to 259 [0.32%] cases) and travel time. Heterogeneity in hospital organisational features caused simultaneous improvement and deterioration of predicted neonatal mortality. Consequences vary for subgroups. We demonstrate that (in The Netherlands) centralisation of acute obstetric care according to the 'closure-of-the-smallest-rule' yields suboptimal outcomes. In order to develop an optimal strategy one would need to consider all positive and negative effects, e.g., organisational heterogeneity of closing and surviving hospitals, differential effects for patient subgroups, increased travel time, and financial aspects. The provided framework may be beneficial for other countries considering centralisation of acute obstetric care. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Uncertainty exists about the generalizability of the trial results for the Dutch healthcare setting due to possible discrepancies in treatment allocation. Retrospective patient chart review was performed for 141 patients treated with first line RT plus cetuximab or RT alone, diagnosed in 2007-2010 in two head and neck treatment centers. Combined with aggregated population-based data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and patient level clinical trial data, use of cetuximab in Dutch daily practice was assessed through comparison of patient characteristics, treatment characteristics and treatment outcomes between trial and daily practice. 61 daily practice patients fulfilled the selection criteria. In line with Dutch guidelines, RT plus cetuximab is prescribed in patients requiring combined therapy unfit to receive traditional platinum-based chemotherapeutics. These patients have unfavorable baseline characteristics, due to selection on-amongst others-high age of the patients. Beyond 1 year after treatment start, patients treated with RT plus cetuximab in daily practice died earlier than patients treated with RT plus cetuximab in the trial. Selective treatment allocation in daily practice limits generalizability of EMR 062202-006 trial results.

Our study was conducted among older individuals (a parts per thousand yen65) who had recently been discharged from a hospital. At T1, 3 months after hospital admission, 296/457 patients (65 % response) were interviewed in their homes. At T2 12 months after hospital admission, 242/436 patients (56 % response) were interviewed. Point of departure for the development of the scale was the 20-item Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC), which is proven to be a valid measure to assess chronically-ill patients' assessment of integrated primary care delivery. We tested both the PACIC and new instrument by means of structural equation modeling, and examined its validity and reliability. After eliminating 10 items of the PACIC, the confirmatory factor analyses revealed good indices of fit with the 10-item Older Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (O-PACIC) Scale. To estimate construct validity of the instrument, we looked at correlations between PACIC and O-PACIC scores and the satisfaction with stroke care home subscale (SASC-Home) questionnaire. Both the PACIC and O-PACIC significantly correlated with SASC-Home subscale (at p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001), which indicated validity. This study demonstrated that O-PACIC is a feasible, reliable and valid tool, with strong psychometric properties.

Total costs and effects of breast cancer interventions were estimated using the health care perspective and WHO-CHOICE methodology. Effects were measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Costs were assessed in 2009 United States Dollars (US$). To the extent available, analyses were based on locally obtained data. In Costa Rica, the current strategy of treating breast cancer in stages I to IV at a 80% coverage level seems to be the most cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$ 4,739 per DALY averted. At a coverage level of 95%, biennial clinical breast examination (CBE) screening could improve Costa Rica's population health twofold, and can still be considered very cost-effective (ICER US$5,964/DALY). For Mexico, our results indicate that at 95% coverage a mass-media awareness raising program (MAR) could be the most cost-effective (ICER US$5,021/DALY). If more resources are available in Mexico, biennial mammography screening for women 50-70 yrs (ICER US$12,718/DALY), adding trastuzumab (ICER US$13,994/DALY) or screening women 40-70 yrs biennially plus trastuzumab (ICER US$17,115/DALY) are less cost-effective options. We recommend both Costa Rica and Mexico to engage in MAR, CBE or mammography screening programs, depending on their budget. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution however, as the evidence on the intervention effectiveness is uncertain. Also, these programs require several organizational, budgetary and human resources, and the accessibility of breast cancer diagnostic, referral, treatment and palliative care facilities should be improved simultaneously. A gradual implementation of early detection programs should give the respective Ministries of Health the time to negotiate the required budget, train the required human resources and understand possible socioeconomic barriers.",,Science & Technology - Other Topics

This work is not generally accommodated by evidence-based guidelines, which generally promote a uniform, predefined approach to solving healthcare problems that risk narrowing the opportunities for diagnostic work in healthcare practice. Consequently, guidelines are often criticised as too general to solve situated, individual healthcare problems and gaps between guidelines and their implementation are often reported. The Netherlands has developed a guideline for problem behaviour in elderly care, explicitly designed for diagnostic work, thus stimulating a situated approach. Relational problem behaviour is highly embedded in its context. The guideline stimulates diagnostic work, which helps to unravel problem behaviour and is opening alternatives in elderly care. Diagnostic work does not transfer guideline development problems to healthcare practice, but simply structures the decision-making process without giving a predefined answer. Diagnostic work is thus important to consider in order to avoid a gap between guideline development and implementation.",elderly care,History & Philosophy of Science

To alleviate the shortage of kidney donors, many advances have been made to improve the utilization of living donors deemed incompatible with their intended recipient.

This review discusses the various approaches to matching and allocation in KPD. In particular, it focuses on the underlying principles of matching and allocation approaches, the combination of KPD with other strategies such as ABO incompatible transplantation, the organization of KPD, and important future challenges. As the transplant community strives to balance quantity and equity of transplants to achieve the best possible outcomes, determining the right long-term allocation strategy becomes increasingly important. In this light, challenges include making full use of the various modalities that are now available through integrated and optimized matching software, encouragement of transplant centers to fully participate, improving transplant rates by focusing on the expected long-run number of transplants, and selecting uniform allocation criteria to facilitate international pools.",transplantation across the blood-type barrier,Transplantation

The success of client participation is usually measured in terms of the extent to which clients have a say in the participation process. Many articles have concluded that client participation is limited; professionals often still control the participation process and outcomes. Objective The objective of this study is to gain insight into (i) the practice of client participation within a quality improvement collaborative in mental health care and (ii) the consequences of a Foucauldian conceptualization of power in analysing practices of client participation. Design We used an ethnographic design consisting of observations of national events and improvement team meetings and interviews with the collaborative's team members and programme managers. Results Contrary to many studies on client participation, we found both clients and service providers frequently felt powerless in its practice. Professionals and clients alike struggled with the contributions clients could make to the improvement processes and what functions they should fulfil. Moreover, professionals did not want to exert power upon clients, but ironically just for that reason sometimes struggled with shaping practices of client participation. This mutual powerlessness (partly) disappeared when clients helped to determine and execute specific improvement actions instead of participating in improvement teams. Conclusion Recognizing that power is inescapable might allow for a more substantive discussion concerning the consequences that power arrangements produce, rather than looking at who is exerting how much power.",service user involvement,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

The existence of the Beveridge NHS model in England, and a Bismarckian insurance system in The Netherlands perhaps suggest that a comparison of the two countries is at best limited, and reinforced by the different Enthoven-inspired competitive models each has adopted. However, we contend that there are positive and negative issues arising from introducing competition into health care-, e.g. concerns about equity and benefits of efficiencies-which go beyond national boundaries and different systems and reflect the global paradigm shift towards the use of market forces in previously non-market areas such as health. The article examines the situation in England following the HSCA 2012 and The Netherlands following the 2006 reforms before analysing two areas of common ground: the focus in both countries on competition on quality (as opposed to price) and integrated care, which is assuming ever greater significance. We suggest that our combined insights (as a health lawyer and competition lawyer respectively) coupled with a comparative approach create a novel contribution to current calls for a wider public debate about the real role of markets in health care over and above simple characterisation as a force for good or bad.",The Netherlands,Legal Medicine

The cross-sectional questionnaire-based study included 1,254 patients with cardiovascular diseases, 725 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 253 with diabetes (total, 2232/4200; 53 % response rate). Social and physical functioning correlated significantly with SMAs and well-being (all p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.001). After controlling for background characteristics, multiple regression showed that social and physical functioning were still related to SMAs (beta = 0.32-0.12; both p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.001) and well-being (beta = 0.39-0.14; both p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.001).

SMAs of chronically ill are related to their social and physical functioning. We found indications that chronically ill patients reporting lower levels of social and physical functioning are worse self-managers than are those with higher levels of functioning. Furthermore, SMAs may mediate the relationships between social and physical functioning and well-being. Self-management interventions aiming to enhance SMAs more broadly than traditional interventions aiming only to prevent functional decline are expected to improve SMAs and enhance well-being among chronically ill patients.",Physical functioning,Social Sciences - Other Topics

How they have affected existing governance mechanisms such as self-regulation and state regulation has remained largely unexplored, however. This article examines the origins and consequences of institutional layering in governing healthcare quality. Dutch health care, where a market-based system has been introduced, is used as a case study. The results show that this market-based system did not replace but modified existing institutional arrangements. As a result, hospitals have to deal with the fragmentation of quality demands. Using the concept of institutional layering, this study shows how different arrangements interact. As a consequence, the introduction of a certain policy reform will work out differently in different countries and policy sectors. Our archaeological' study in this layering can be seen as an example of how such incremental change can be studied in detail.",,Public Administration

Methods: Our cohort study included 139 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who were treated outside of a clinical study; 72 received bortezomib and 67 did not receive bortezomib. Detailed data were retrospectively collected from medical records in 38% of Dutch hospitals. Results: All patients received second-line treatment; 65%, 40%, and 14%, received three, four, or five or more lines of therapy. Neither a specific treatment sequence nor an appropriate comparator could be identified because of large variation in regimes. Kaplan-Meier curves showed an increased overall survival (mean [median] 29.5 [33.2] vs. 28.0 [21.6] months) for patients treated with bortezomib (Wilcoxon P = 0.01). Total mean costs were (sic)81,626 (range (sic)17,793-(sic)229,783) and (sic)52,760 (range (sic)748-(sic)179,571) for patients receiving bortezomib and patients not receiving bortezomib, respectively. Patients treated with bortezomib, however, were not comparable to other patients despite attempts to correct for confounding. Therefore, it was impossible to develop a feasible model to obtain a valid incremental cost-effectiveness estimate. Conclusions: It was possible to develop evidence on bortezomib's use, effects, and costs in everyday practice. Much uncertainty, however, remained regarding its cost-effectiveness. Policymakers should carefully consider whether outcomes research sufficiently decreases uncertainty or whether other options (e g, finance- and/or outcomes-based risk-sharing arrangements) are more appropriate to ensure sufficient value for money of expensive drugs.",uncertainty,Health Care Sciences & Services

Profiling is increasingly being used to generate input for improvement efforts in health care. For these efforts to be successful, profiles must reflect true provider performance, requiring an appropriate statistical model. Sophisticated models are available to account for the specific features of performance data, but they may be difficult to use and explain to providers. Objective. To assess the influence of the statistical model on the performance profiles of primary care providers. Data Source. Administrative data (2006-2008) on 2.8 million members of a Dutch health insurer who were registered with 1 of 4396 general practitioners. Methods. Profiles are constructed for 6 quality measures and 5 resource use measures, controlling for differences in case mix. Models include ordinary least squares, generalized linear models, and multilevel models. Separately for each model, providers are ranked on z scores and classified as outlier if belonging to the 10% with the worst or best performance. The impact of the model is evaluated using the weighted kappa for rankings overall, percentage agreement on outlier designation, and changes in rankings over time. Results. Agreement among models was relatively high overall (kappa typically >0.85). Agreement on outlier designation was more variable and often below 80%, especially for high outliers. Rankings were more similar for processes than for outcomes and expenses. Agreement among annual rankings per model was low for all models. Conclusions. Differences among models were relatively small, but the choice of statistical model did affect the rankings. In addition, most measures appear to be driven largely by chance, regardless of the model that is used. Profilers should pay careful attention to the choice of both the statistical model and the performance measures.",managed care,Medical Informatics

Actual use of SeCZ TaLK was assessed at follow-up (N = 105). Professionals with higher self-efficacy and more experience in discussing sexual health were more likely to intend to use the game. At follow-up, intention to use explained 21% of the variance in actual use. SeCZ TaLK fits easily into the daily practice of professionals working in assisted-living and day-care facilities; other professionals experienced greater difficulty integrating the game into their practice. Despite this, SeCZ TaLk was also used across a wide range of settings including in psycho-educational groups, group consultations in hospitals and group therapy in rehabilitation centres.

Yet little attention has been paid to the possibility of constructive compromises that enable public managers to deal with conflicting values simultaneously rather than separately. The authors use Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thevenot's theory of justification to extend current conceptualizations of management of conflicting values. On the basis of a qualitative study of daily practices of Dutch health care managers (executives and middle managers), they show how compromises are constructed and justified to significant others. Because compromises are fragile and open to criticism, managers have to perform continuous ""justification work"" that entails not only the use of rhetoric but also the adaption of behavior and material objects. By inscribing compromises into objects and behavior, managers are able to solidify compromises, thereby creating temporary stability in times of public sector change.",,Public Administration

This paper aims to collect all the empirical evidence on the factors that make franchising work and to integrate this evidence in a framework. A narrative synthesis was performed of 126 peer-reviewed empirical journal articles. This review shows how the outcomes of franchising are determined by five major clusters of factors: ownership structure, business format design, contract design, behavior of the franchisor and the franchisee and their interaction, and the age and size of the system and its units. It identifies what franchisors and franchisees need to do to be successful and which evidence gaps and conflicting results remain. To yield better outcomes for both the franchisor and the franchisee, they should work on a recognizable brand name and a good working relationship; in addition, they should have suitable skills and attitudes as well as contractual exclusive territories. For further improvement of franchisee outcomes, high-quality franchisor support, decentralized decision-making, selection tools and fair contracts are essential. The effects of a high franchise proportion, active ownership, knowledge exchange and standardized operating instructions are contingent on other structural and contextual factors in the system. Conflicts and tying should be prevented. Hardly any research has been undertaken into which franchise designs are valued by customers.

In this systematic review, economic evaluations of enteral medical nutrition in the management of disease-related malnutrition (DRM) were reviewed and qualified to estimate the economic value. Initially, 481 studies were found, of which 37 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and were rated on their quality using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument. The final review focused on the high QHES quality economic evaluation studies. As both the studied medical nutrition intervention and the form of the economic evaluation varied, a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) was not attempted but a critical analysis and comparison of the individual study results were performed. ONS was the most studied intervention, covering several patient populations and different health care settings. Outcomes included cost savings (n = 3), no significant extra costs per unit of clinical and/or functional improvement (n = 1), or significantly higher costs per unit of clinical and/or functional improvement but still cost-effective for the used threshold (n = 4).

At T1, overall quality, self-management support, delivery system design, and integration of chronic care components, as well as health care delivery and clinical information systems and decision support, had improved. At 12, overall quality again improved significantly, as did community linkages, delivery system design, clinical information systems, decision support and integration of chronic care components, and self-management support.

Therefore, these consequences are not fully understood. This paper reviews the consequences of population aging for health expenditure growth in Western countries by combining insights from epidemiological and health economics research. Based on a conceptual model of health care use, we first review evidence on the relationship between age and health expenditures to provide insight into the direct effect of aging on health expenditure growth. Second, we discuss the interaction between aging and the main societal drivers of health expenditures. Aging most likely influences growth in health expenditures indirectly, through its influence on these societal factors. The literature shows that the direct effect of aging depends strongly on underlying health and disability. Commonly used approximations of health, like age or mortality, insufficiently capture complex dynamics in health. Population aging moderately increases expenditures on acute care and strongly increases expenditures on long-term care. The evidence further shows that the most important driver of health expenditure growth, medical technology, interacts strongly with age and health, i.e., population aging reinforces the influence of medical technology on health expenditure growth and vice versa. We therefore conclude that population aging will remain in the centre of policy debate. Further research should focus on the changes in health that explain the effect of longevity gains on health expenditures, and on the interactions between aging and other societal factors driving expenditure growth.",Long-term care,Geriatrics & Gerontology

When simulating a reservoir, one must account for the physical and chemical processes taking place in the subsurface. Rock and fluid properties are crucial when describing the flow in porous media. In this paper, the authors are concerned with estimating the permeability field of a reservoir. The problem of estimating model parameters such as permeability is often referred to as a history-matching problem in reservoir engineering. Currently, one of the most widely used methodologies which address the history-matching problem is the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). EnKF is a Monte Carlo implementation of the Bayesian update problem. Nevertheless, the EnKF methodology has certain limitations that encourage the search for an alternative method.For this reason, a new approach based on graphical models is proposed and studied. In particular, the graphical model chosen for this purpose is a dynamic non-parametric Bayesian network (NPBN). This is the first attempt to approach a history-matching problem in reservoir simulation using a NPBN-based method. A two-phase, two-dimensional flow model was implemented for a synthetic reservoir simulation exercise, and initial results are shown. The methods' performances are evaluated and compared. This paper features a completely novel approach to history matching and constitutes only the first part (part I) of a more detailed investigation. For these reasons (novelty and incompleteness), many questions are left open and a number of recommendations are formulated, to be investigated in part II of the same paper.",Probabilistic model learning,Geology

To effectively do so, evaluations need to include all relevant costs and effects of an intervention. Informal care provided by family or friends is an important element of care for many patients, but can have a profound impact on the health and well-being of carers. Therefore, informal care should be considered in economic evaluations of health interventions. Different methods to do so exist. This paper provides an overview of state-of-the-art methods available for this purpose, illustrated with practical examples. Since the choice of measurement and valuation technique depends on the type and perspective of the economic evaluation, this paper supports researchers in choosing the appropriate techniques to include informal care in their economic evaluation of a health intervention. We discuss the different approaches to measuring and valuing informal care, covering both partial and full valuation methods, allowing inclusion as costs or effects.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

This implies that insurers and providers compete on price and quality while the regulator sets certain rules to achieve public objectives such as solidarity. Two regulatory aspects of this scheme are that insurers are not allowed to risk rate their premiums and are compensated for predictable variation in individual medical expenses (i.e., risk equalization). Research, however, indicates that the current risk equalization is imperfect, which confronts insurers and consumers with incentives for risk selection. The goal of this paper is to review the concept, possibilities and potential effects of risk selection in the Dutch basic health insurance. We conclude that the possibilities for risk selection are numerous and a potential threat to solidarity, efficiency and quality of care.

A generic operational model is defined as a formal description of operations performed to deliver a health service that is applicable in a wide range of health service delivery settings. The systematic review of the literature which forms the basis of our research synthesis includes peer reviewed publications from business management databases (SCOPUS) as well as medical databases (Pubmed). Our search resulted in more than 4000 recent papers of which 116 papers met the inclusion criteria. This paper reports our synthesis from the included papers on four main questions: 1) why are models used? 2) what is modeled? 3) what models are used and how are they developed? 4) what are the achievements? Our systematic review reveals that few papers report achievements which qualify as empirical evidence to guide the application of operational models for health services.

Standardisation of the definition of a positive SeHCAT test should be the first step in assessing the usefulness of this test. As there is no reference standard for the diagnosis of BAM and SeHCAT testing provides a continuous measure of metabolic function, diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies are not the most appropriate study design. However, in studies where all patients are tested with SeHCAT and all patients are treated with BASs, response to treatment can provide a surrogate reference standard; further DTA studies of this type may provide information on the ability of SeHCAT to predict response to BASs. A potentially more informative option would be multivariate regression modelling of treatment response (dependent variable), with SeHCAT result and other candidate clinical predictors as covariates.

The vast majority of biomarker discovery studies has concentrated on plasma/serum as an easily accessible source. Although numerous markers have been identified, their added predictive value on top of traditional risk factors has been limited, as the biological specimen does not specifically reflect expression profiles related with CVD progression and because the signal is often diluted by marker release from other organs. In contrast to serum markers, circulating cells serve as indicators of the actual disease state due to their active role in the pathogenesis of CVD and are responsible for the majority of secreted biomarkers. Therefore, the CIRCULATING CELLS study was initiated, focusing on the cellular effectors of atherosclerosis in the circulation. In total, 714 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) symptoms were included. Blood cell fractions (monocytes, T-lymphocytes, platelets, granulocytes, PBMC) of all individual patients were isolated and stored for analysis. Concomitantly, extensive flow cytometric characterization of these populations was performed. From each patient, a detailed clinical profile together with extensive questionnaires about medical history and life style was obtained. Various high-throughput -omics approaches (protein, mRNA, miRNA) are currently being undertaken.

During the 1990s hospital waiting times increased as a result of the introduction of fixed budgets and capacity constraints for specialists, in addition to the fixed global hospital budgets that were already in place since the 1980s. To tackle these increased waiting times over the years 2000-2011 several policies were implemented, including a change from fixed budgets to activity-based funding for both hospitals and specialists - and increased competition among hospitals. All together these measures resulted in a strong reduction of waiting times. In 2011 mean expected waiting times for almost all surgical procedures varied from 2 to 6 weeks, well below the broadly accepted specified maximum waiting times. Hence, in the Netherlands hospital waiting times are currently not an important policy concern. Since the waiting time reduction was achieved at the expense of rapidly growing hospital costs, these have become now the primary policy concern. This has triggered the introduction of new powerful supply-side constraints in 2012, which may cause waiting times to increase for the coming years. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To unburden participants, researchers often collect data intermittently (i.e., in at least 3 months a year). However, comparability of intermittent v. continuous data collection is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to compare costs estimated with intermittent data collection of health care utilization with those based on continuous data collection. Methods: We used continuous health care utilization data from a trial with 12 months of follow-up and simulated several intermittent data collection patterns. Then 3 imputation techniquesindividual mean (IM), last observation carried forward (LOCF) and next observation carried backward (NOCB)were used to estimate total annual costs. Estimated annual costs were compared with observed annual costs from continuous data collection both in the original sample and in 1000 bootstrap samples. Results: Analyses showed that intermittent data collection using cost diaries may offer good estimates of the actual total annual health expenditures. However, estimations of groups of costs differ between data collection patterns and imputation methods. The best estimations of annual total costs and groups of costs were obtained by random cohort data collection, using 3 random cohorts, ensuring that at least a third of the participants were measuring costs each month, combined with IM imputation. Intermittent data collection of health expenditures carries a small risk of missing infrequent expensive events. Conclusions: Continuous cost data collection remains the first choice. However, if intermittent measurement is chosen, we recommend calculating annual costs from intermittent data collection in random cohorts, combined with IM imputation.",imputation,Medical Informatics

A major advantage of a competitive health insurance market is that insurers are stimulated to act as well-motivated prudent purchasers of healthcare on behalf of their enrolees, and that consumers can choose among these purchasers. To emphasize the insurers' role of purchasers of care we denote them, as well as other entities that can fulfil this role (e.g. fundholding community health centres), as 'Mutual Healthcare Purchasers' (MHPs). As feasible proposals for creating competition in China's health insurance sector have yet to be made, we suggest two potential approaches to create competition among MHPs: (1) separating finance and operation of social health insurance and allowing consumer choice among operators of social health insurance schemes; (2) allowing consumer choice among hind-holding community health centres. Although the benefits of competition are widely accepted in China, the problematic consequences of a free competitive health insurance market especially in relation to affordability and accessibility are generally neglected. To solve the problems of lack of affordability and inaccessibility that would occur in the case of unregulated competition among MHPs, at least the following regulations are proposed to the Chinese policy makers: a 'standard benefit package' for basic health insurance, a 'risk-equalization scheme', and 'open enrolment'. Potential obstacles for implementing a risk equalization scheme are examined based on theoretical arguments and international experiences. We conclude that allowing consumer choice among MHPs and implementing a risk equalization scheme in China is politically and technically complex. Therefore, the Chinese government should prepare carefully for a market-oriented reform in its healthcare sector and adopt a strategic approach in the implementation procedure.

This study looked at the variation in prices, volume, and quality of cataract surgeries since the introduction of price competition in 2006. We found no price convergence over time and constant price differences between hospitals. Quality indicators generally showed positive results in cataract care, though the quality and scope of the indicators was suboptimal at this stage. Furthermore, we found limited between-hospital variation in quality and there was no clear-cut relation between prices and quality. Volume of cataract care strongly increased in the period studied. These findings indicate that health insurers may not have been able to drive prices down, make trade-offs between price and quality, and selectively contract health care without usable quality information. Positive results coming out from the 2006 reform should not be taken for granted. Looking forward, future research on similar topics and with newer data should clarify the extent to which these findings can be generalized. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It has been suggested that selective mortality and institutionalization could be important factors driving the convergence at higher ages. We use eight waves of a health survey linked to four registries (on mortality, hospitalizations, (municipal) residence status and taxable incomes) to test this hypothesis. We construct life cycle profiles of health for birth year/gender/income groups from the health surveys (based on 128,689 observations) and exploit the registries to obtain precise estimates of individual probabilities of mortality and institutionalization using a seven year observation period for 2,521,122 individuals. We generate selection corrected health profiles using an inverse probability weighting procedure and find that attrition is indeed not random: older, poorer and unhealthier individuals are significantly more likely not to survive the next year and to be admitted to an institution. While these selection effects are very significant, they are not very large. We therefore reject the hypothesis that selective dropout is an important determinant of the differential health trajectories by income over the life course in the Netherlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of chronic care management in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) while taking heterogeneity into account, enabling the understanding of and the decision making about such programmes. Three investigated sources of heterogeneity were study quality, length of follow-up, and number of intervention components. Methods We performed a review of previously published reviews and meta-analyses on COPD chronic care management. Their primary studies that were analyzed as statistical, clinical and methodological heterogeneity were present. Meta-regression analyses were performed to explain the variances among the primary studies. Results Generally, the included reviews showed positive results on quality of life and hospitalizations. Inconclusive effects were found on emergency department visits and no effects on mortality. Pooled effects on hospitalizations, emergency department visits and quality of life of primary studies did not reach significant improvement. No effects were found on mortality. Meta-regression showed that the number of components of chronic care management programmes explained present heterogeneity for hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Four components showed significant effects on hospitalizations, whereas two components had significant effects on emergency department visits. Methodological study quality and length of follow-up did not significantly explain heterogeneity. Conclusions This study demonstrated that COPD chronic care management has the potential to improve outcomes of care; heterogeneity in outcomes was explained.

A total of 257/692 adolescents completed the questionnaire (41 % response rate). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study population. Correlations and regression analyses were performed to reveal significant predictors of quality of life.

The term personalized medicine is used regularly but interpreted in different ways. This article approaches the term by starting with a broad view of clinical medicine, where three components can be distinguished: the questions (e.g., what is the diagnosis?), the methods used to answer them (e.g., a test), and the available actions (e.g., to give or not give a particular drug). Existing definitions of personalized medicine disagree about which questions, methods, and actions fall within its domain. Some define the term narrowly, referring to the use of a diagnostic test to predict drug response, thereby clarifying whether or not a patient will benefit from that drug. An example of this combination is the HER2/neu test to predict the effectiveness of trastuzumab in breast cancer. Many who adopt this definition associate the concept of personalized medicine with fields such as genetics, genomics, and other types of ""-omics."" In contrast, others view personalized medicine as a concept that has always existed, because medicine has always considered the needs of the individual. One definition of personalized medicine that accommodates both interpretations is ""the use of combined knowledge (genetic or otherwise) about a person to predict disease susceptibility, disease prognosis, or treatment response and thereby improve that person's health."" This predictive ability can increase over time through innovations in various technologies, resulting in further improvements in health outcomes. Moreover, these developments can lead to a better understanding of the underlying causes of disease, which can eventually lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of individual patients. In that sense, a truly personalized form of medicine can also be seen as an ideal, a goal that will be achieved only after multiple advances in science. Although the term personalized medicine was rechristened somewhat recently, our ability to personalize medicine will continue to advance in unimaginable ways as we come to learn more about the heterogeneity that exists among individuals and diseases.",stratified medicine,Health Care Sciences & Services

In this article, we present a list of 10 specific issues that we argue pose specific methodological challenges that require careful consideration when designing and conducting robust model-based economic evaluations in the context of personalized medicine. Key issues are related to the correct framing of the research question, interpretation of test results, data collection of medical management options after obtaining test results, and expressing the value of tests. the need to formulate the research question clearly and be explicit and specific about the technology being evaluated is essential because various test kits can have the same purpose and yet differ in predictive value, costs, and relevance to practice and patient populations. The correct reporting of sensitivity/specificity, and especially the false negatives and false positives (which are population dependent), of the investigated tests is also considered as a key element. This requires additional structural complexity to establish the relationship between the test result and the consecutive treatment changes and outcomes. This process involves translating the test characteristics into clinical utility, and therefore outlining the clinical and economic consequences of true and false positives and true and false negatives. Information on treatment patterns and on their costs and outcomes, however, is often lacking, especially for false-positive and false-negative test results. The analysis can even become very complex if different tests are combined or sequentially used This potential complexity can be handled by explicitly showing how these tests are going to be used in practice and then working with the combined sensitivities and specificities of the tests. Each of these issues leads to a higher degree of uncertainty in economic models designed to assess the added value of personalized medicine compared with their simple pharmaceutical counterparts. To some extent, these problems can be overcome by performing early population-level simulations, which can lead to the identification and collection of data on critical input parameters. Finally, it is important to understand that a test strategy does not necessarily lead to more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). it is possible that the test will lead to not only fewer QALYs but also fewer costs, which can be defined as ""decremental"" cost per QALYs. Different decision criteria are needed to interpret such results.",personalized medicine,Health Care Sciences & Services

Focusing on the recent EU initiatives regarding the quality systems of the Member States and the quality of services, this paper shows how the depth of EU interference has increased from sharing information to standardization and even to the first signs of enforcement.

This cross-sectional study used the general self-efficacy scale and DISABKIDS condition-generic module to survey adolescents (92/293; 31 %) with type I diabetes, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, cystic fibrosis, kidney/urological conditions, and neuromuscular disorders; and parents (121/293; 41 %). Self perceived and parents' perceived general self-efficacy of adolescents was compared using paired t-tests, and adolescents' quality of life and general self-efficacy were compared among conditions using analysis of variance. Bivariate correlations between general self-efficacy and quality of life were identified, and multiple regression sought predictors of quality of life after controlling for background variables. Social quality of life was lowest among those with neuromuscular disorders. General self-efficacy was highest among adolescents with cystic fibrosis and lowest among those with urological conditions. Parents' perceptions of general self-efficacy were higher than adolescents' (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05), although absolute differences were small. General self-efficacy perceived by parents and adolescents was related to emotional, physical, and social quality of life. Adolescents' perceived self-efficacy predicted all quality of life domains. Parents' perceptions of the adolescents self-efficacy predicted the adolescents' social quality of life (beta = 0.19; p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.01). General self-efficacy of adolescents with chronic conditions as perceived by themselves and their parents is important for adolescents' quality of life. Interventions to improve general self-efficacy should benefit quality of life among these adolescents.",Parent,Sociology

The original SF-6D valuation study collected 3503 standard gambled responses from 611 UK respondents to predict quality-adjusted life year (QALY) values. Methods. Using 19,980 paired comparison responses from 666 US respondents and a stacked probit model, the 25 coefficients of the original SF-6D multiattribute utility (MAU) regression were estimated, such that each coefficient represents a QALY decrement. The US QALY predictions were compared with UK predictions using 8428 SF-6D states in the US Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS), 1998 to 2003. Results. Twenty-two of the 25 decrements in the SF-6D MAU regression are statistically significant. The remaining decrements are insignificant based on US and UK results. The US and UK QALY predictions for the MHOS SF-6D states are remarkably similar given differences in experimental design, format, and sampling (Lin's coefficient of agreement, 0.941; absolute mean difference, 0.043). Limitations. The underlying theoretical framework for the study design and econometric analysis builds from the episodic random utility model and the concept of QALYs and inherits their limitations. Conclusions. This study enhances the potential for US comparative effectiveness research by translating SF-6D states into US QALYs as well as improves upon discrete choice experiment design and econometric methods for health valuation.",statistical methods,Medical Informatics

Dynamic processes in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) are typically described using cohort simulations, which can be implemented as Markov models, or alternatively using systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In the field of CEA, simple and potentially inaccurate single-step algorithms are commonly used for solving ODEs, which can potentially induce bias, especially if an incorrect step size is used. The aims of this project were 1) to implement and demonstrate the use of a modern and well-established hybrid linear multistep ODE solver algorithm (LSODA) in the context of CEA using the statistical scripting language R and 2) to quantify bias in outcome for a case example CEA as generated by a commonly used single-step ODE solver algorithm. Methods. A previously published CEA comparing the adjuvant breast cancer therapies anastrozole and tamoxifen was used as a case example to implement the computational framework. A commonly used single-step algorithm was compared with the proposed multistep algorithm to quantify bias in the single-step method. Results. A framework implementing the multistep ODE solver LSODA was successfully developed. When a single-step ODE solver with step size of 1 year was used, incremental life-years gained was underestimated by 0.016 years (5.6% relative error, RE) and 158 pound (6.8% RE) compared with the multistep method. Conclusion. The framework was found suitable for the conduct of CEAs. We demonstrated how the use of single-step algorithms with insufficiently small step sizes causes unnecessary bias in outcomes measures of CEAs. Scripting languages such as R can further improve transparency, reproducibility, and overall integrity in the field of health economics.",tamoxifen,Medical Informatics

The new variants of the TTO, namely lead-time TTO and lag-time TTO, along with the classic approach to TTO were compared using two durations for the health states (15 and 20 years). The study tested whether these methods yield comparable health-state values. TTO tasks were administered online. It was found that lag-time TTO produced lower values than lead-time TTO and that the difference was larger in the longer time frame. Classic TTO values most resembled those of the lag-time TTO in a 20-year time frame in terms of mean absolute difference. The relative importance of different domains of health was systematically affected by the duration of the health state. In the tasks with a 10-year health-state duration, anxiety/depression had the largest negative impact on health-state values; in the tasks with a 5-year duration, the pain/discomfort domain had the largest negative impact.",Health-state preferences,Health Care Sciences & Services

This can lead to an overestimation if compensation mechanisms occur. Until now only Dutch data are available on the influence of compensation mechanisms on lost productivity, but between-country differences in frequency and type of compensation mechanisms can be expected. The objective of this study was to understand whether compensation mechanisms for days absent from paid work differ in type and frequency across countries and to explore whether this would result in between-country differences in relevant lost productivity. Methods: Data from a cross-sectional survey among respondents with rheumatic disorders from four countries were the basis for this study. Analyses focused on respondents with paid employment who reported absence in the last 3 months. The different compensation mechanisms are described and the resulting lost productivity in terms of days absent was calculated with and without taking compensation mechanisms into account. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine which variables influence compensation mechanisms leading to relevant lost productivity. Results: The results indicate that compensation mechanisms occur and are relevant in all four countries. Between-country differences in the type and frequency of compensation mechanisms and relevant lost productivity were observed. The logistic regression analyses indicate that, correcting for other variables, this is also the case for the use of compensation mechanisms leading to relevant lost productivity. Conclusions: Between-country differences in compensation mechanisms in case of absenteeism exist and could vary to such an extent that foreign relevant lost productivity data should be used with caution.",rheumatic disorders,Health Care Sciences & Services

There has always been considerable uncertainty at product launch about the ultimate real-world clinical and economic performance of new products, but this appears to have increased in recent years. PBRSAs represent one mechanism for reducing this uncertainty through greater investment in evidence collection while a technology is used within a health care system. The objective of this Task Force report was to set out the standards that should be applied to ""good practices""-both research and operational- in the use of a PBRSA, encompassing questions around the desirability, design, implementation, and evaluation of such an arrangement This report provides practical recommendations for the development and application of state-of-the-art methods to be used when considering, using, or reviewing PBRSAs. Key findings and recommendations include the following. Additional evidence collection is costly, and there are numerous barriers to establishing viable and cost-effective PBRSAs: negotiation, monitoring, and evaluation costs can be substantial. For good research practice in PBRSAs, it is critical to match the appropriate study and research design to the uncertainties being addressed. Good governance processes are also essential. The information generated as part of PBRSAs has public good aspects, bringing ethical and professional obligations, which need to be considered from a policy perspective. The societal desirability of a particular PBRSA is fundamentally an issue as to whether the cost of additional data collection is justified by the benefits of improved resource allocation decisions afforded by the additional evidence generated and the accompanying reduction in uncertainty. The ex post evaluation of a PBRSA should, however, be a multidimensional exercise that assesses many aspects, including not only the impact on long-term cost-effectiveness and whether appropriate evidence was generated but also process indicators, such as whether and how the evidence was used in coverage or reimbursement decisions, whether budget and time were appropriate, and whether the governance arrangements worked well There is an important gap in the literature of structured ex post evaluation of PBRSAs. As an innovation in and of themselves, PBRSAs should also be evaluated from a long-run societal perspective in terms of their impact on dynamic efficiency (eliciting the optimal amount of innovation).",risk-sharing,Health Care Sciences & Services

Although major changes have been implemented in ACS treatment since the 1980s, which highly influenced mortality and morbidity, CR programs have barely changed and only few data are available on the optimal CR format in these patients. We postulated that standard CR programs followed by relatively brief maintenance programs and booster sessions, including behavioural techniques and focusing on incorporating lifestyle changes into daily life, can improve long-term adherence to lifestyle modifications. These strategies might result in improved (cardiac) mortality and morbidity in a cost-effective fashion.

Tests of creativity are commonly based on divergent thinking tasks. The scoring of the ideational output of such tasks should ideally be done based on fluency (the number of ideas generated), flexibility (the number of categories into which the generated ideas can be partitioned), and originality (the number of unique or unusual ideas). However, most scoring procedures do not take into account all three dimensions. Building on the Creativity Quotient (CQ) measure (Snyder, Mitchell, Bossomaier & Pallier, 2004), which covers fluency and flexibility, an adjusted CQ and two CQs based on diversity type measures are proposed. Findings indicated that an adjusted measure that weights categories based on their discriminative power was most strongly related to other predictors of performance on creative tasks and thus presents an important advance over the original CQ.",,Psychology

Health state values are applied in health technology assessments, and in that context comparability of information is desired. In this article, we discuss several alternative specifications of TTO presented in the literature. The defining elements of these specifications are identified as being either methodological, procedural or analytical in nature. Where possible, it is indicated how these elements affect health state values (i.e., upward or downward).

We focus on 23andMe, a genetic testing company that collects genetic material and self-reported information about disease from its customers. Integral to this research method are relations of trust embedded in the information exchange: trust in customers' data; trust between researchers/company and research subjects; trust in genetics; trust in the machine. We examine the performative dimension of these trust relations, drawing on Shapin and Schaffer's (1985) discussion of how material, literary and social technologies are used in research in order to establish trust. Our scepticism of the company's motives for building trust with the self-reporting consumer forces us to consider our own motives. How does the use of customer data for research purposes by 23andMe differ from the research practices of social scientists, especially those who also study digital traces? By interrogating the use of self-reported data in the genetic testing context, we examine our ethical responsibilities in studying the digital selves of others using internet methods.

To bring care in line with guidelines, we planned an intervention to involve nurse specialists on UI in primary care and assessed this in a randomised controlled trial. Alongside this intervention, we assessed consumer satisfaction among patients and general practitioners (GPs). Methods: Patients' satisfaction with the care provided by either nurse specialists (intervention group) or GPs (control group), respectively, was measured with a self-completed questionnaire. GPs' views on the involvement of nurse specialists were measured in a structured telephone interview. Results: The patient satisfaction score on the care offered by nurse specialists was 8.4 (scale 110), vs. 6.7 for care-as-usual by GPs. Over 85% of patients would recommend nurse specialist care to their best friends and 77% of the GPs considered the role of the nurse specialist to be beneficial, giving it a mean score of 7.2. Conclusions: Although the sample was relatively small and the stability of the results only provisionally established, substituting UI care from GP to nurse specialist appears to be welcomed by both patients and GPs. Small changes like giving additional UI-specific information and devoting more attention to UI (which had been given little attention before) would provide a simple instrument to stimulate patients to change their behaviour in the right direction.",consumer satisfaction,Nursing

Design. A multiple-case cross-sectional study. Methods. Quality improvement teams in 11 quality improvement collaboratives focusing on 11 different topics. Team members received a postal questionnaire at the end of each collaborative. Of the 283 improvement teams, 151 project leaders and 362 team members returned the questionnaire. Results. Analysis of variance revealed that teams varied widely on perceived effectiveness. Especially, members in the Prevention of Malnutrition and Prevention of Medication Errors collaboratives perceived a higher effectiveness than other groups. Multilevel regression analyses showed that educational level of professionals, innovation attributes, organisational support, innovative culture and commitment to change were all significant predictors of perceived effectiveness. In total, 27 center dot 9% of the individual-level variance, 57 center dot 6% of the team-level variance and 80% of the collaborative-level variance could be explained. Conclusion. The innovation's attributes, organisational support, an innovative team culture and professionals' commitment to change are instrumental to perceived effectiveness. The results support the notion that a layered approach is necessary to achieve improvements in quality of care and provides further insight in the determinants of success of quality improvement collaboratives. Relevance to clinical practice. Understanding which factors enhance the impact of quality improvement initiatives can help professionals to achieve breakthrough improvement in care delivery to patients on a wide variety of quality problems.",quality improvement collaborative,Nursing

This is difficult, however, when they must assess complex, uncertain or ambiguous situations in which the pre-defined assessment criteria that inspectorates normally use are either unavailable or contested by the actors involved. In this article, we explore the challenges faced by a partnership of five Dutch inspectorates that carried out a joint inspection on tackling the consequences of youth poverty. This is based on a 20-month ethnographic study, conducted between June 2009 and March 2011. To analyse the data, we applied a theoretical framework based on characterisation and governance of risks. Our study shows that, like many other social problems, poverty among children was associated with complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity. Complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity were tolerated to some degree, for example, during stakeholder participation to provide diverse options for improvement. However, inspectors often did not persist with such participatory processes. The pressure to act that was associated with a strict regulatory role and the regulatory context led the inspectorates to hide the lack of certainty by constructing poverty as a simple problem. As a result, little benefit was derived from increasing participation. We highlight how meeting the two expectations - strengthening the regulatory role and tackling social problems - posed important dilemmas for the inspectorates, especially in situations where knowledge was not available and roles were unclear.",poverty,Biomedical Social Sciences

However, costing studies normally investigate the burden of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) without explicitly examining the impact of specific-disease states on health care costs over time. The objective of this study was to assess time-dependent costs of different health states of human epidermal receptor-2 (HER-2) positive MBC and the factors contributing to these costs. In the Netherlands, HER-2-positive MBC patients were identified in three different hospitals. Resource use was collected during 24 months, which was linked to unit costs and related to time with respect to date of MBC diagnosis, disease progression and death for each individual patient. Subsequently, monthly costs for different health states were calculated. Finally, a nonlinear mixed-effect modelling approach was used to provide a quantitative description of the time course of cumulative progression costs. Costs during stable disease were constant over time with a mean of $4,158. In contrast, monthly costs for progressive disease demonstrated a change over time with the largest costs in the first 2 months after diagnosis (p < 0.005). The developed mixed-effect model adequately described cumulative cost-time course and associated variability. During the last months of life, costs varied over time, with the last month of life as the most expensive one with a mean of $5,811 per patient per month. To reflect costs of HER-2-positive MBC accurately in Markov models, costs for stable disease can be defined time independent, however, costs of progressive disease should be defined time dependent, and costs related to the final months of life should be modelled as such. The mixed-effect model we have developed could now be considered for adequate description of the time-dependent cost of progressive disease.",Time-dependent,Oncology

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is more strongly associated with the risk of progression to T2D than generalized obesity. Therefore examining MS may help to better understand the differences in T2D between the two countries. We assessed whether the Dutch and English differences in T2D prevalence reflect similar differences in MS in Whites, South-Asian Indians and African-Caribbeans living in these two countries. Methods: Secondary analyses of population-based studies of 3010 participants aged 35-60 years. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were estimated using regression models. Results: In general, the Dutch ethnic groups had a higher prevalence of MS than their English counterparts. Adjusted PRs were 1.37[95% confidence interval (CI)1.03-1.82] and 1.52 (1.06-2.19) in White-Dutch men and women compared to White-English men and women; 2.20 (1.14-4.26) and 1.46 (0.96-2.24) in Dutch-African-Caribbean men and women compared to English-African-Caribbean men and women and 0.97 (0.74-1.27) and 1.42 (1.00-2.03) in Dutch-Indian men and women compared with their English-Indian peers, respectively. Similar patterns were also observed for some MS components, e.g. raised fasting glucose in men and central obesity in women. Conclusion: The comparatively high prevalence of MS among Dutch ethnic groups may contribute to their high prevalence of T2D. The high levels of some MS components, e.g. raised fasting glucose in men and central obesity in women add to the high prevalence of MS in Dutch ethnic groups.",,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

In order to compare costs of PEGasparaginase, Erwinia asparaginase and native E. coli asparaginase, we performed a cost-analysis in the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group ALL-10 medium-risk group intensification protocol. Treatment costs were calculated based on patient level data of 84 subjects, and were related to the occurrence of allergy to PEGasparaginase. Simultaneously, decision tree and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The total costs of the intensification course of 30 weeks were $57,893 in patients without PEGasparaginase allergy (n=64). The costs were significantly higher ($113,558) in case of allergy (n=20) necessitating a switch to Erwinia asparaginase. Simulated scenarios (decision tree analysis) using native E. coli asparaginase in intensification showed that the costs of PEGasparaginase were equal to those of native E. coli asparaginase. Also after sensitivity analyses, the costs for PEGasparaginase were equal to those of native E. coli asparaginase. Intensification treatment with native E. coli asparaginase, followed by a switch to PEGasparaginase, and subsequently to Erwinia asparaginase in case of allergy had similar overall costs compared to the treatment with PEGasparaginase as the first-line drug (followed by Erwinia asparaginase in the case of allergy). PEGasparaginase is preferred over native E. coli asparaginase, because it is administered less frequently, with less day care visits. PEGasparaginase is less immunogenic than native E. coli asparaginase and is not more expensive. Asparaginase costs are mainly determined by the percentage of patients who are allergic and require a switch to Erwinia asparaginase.",,Hematology

Methods We developed a health economic model including a hypothetical population consisting of patients with ischemic stroke, admitted within 4.5h from onset, without contraindications for IVT or intra-arterial treatment (IAT). A decision tree and life table were used to assess 6-month and lifetime costs (in Euros) and effects in quality-adjusted life years treatment with IVT alone, IAT alone, and IVT followed by IAT if the patient did not respond to treatment. Several analyses were performed to explore the impact of considerable uncertainty concerning the clinical effectiveness of endovascular treatment. Results Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated a 54% probability of positive incremental lifetime effectiveness of IVT-IAT vs IVT alone. Sensitivity analyses showed significant variation in outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the included treatment strategies at different model assumptions. Conclusions Acceptable cost-effectiveness of IVT-IAT compared to IVT will only be possible if recanalization rates are sufficiently high (>50%), treatment costs of IVT-IAT do not increase, and complication rates remain similar to those reported in the few randomized studies published to date.

Methods: Data were collected through two successive focus-group discussions with six men (aged 23-40 years) living in the same specialized nursing home in the Netherlands. Results: The results showed that the participants wanted to be involved in activities that provide interaction with others in society or community; they desired social participation. Thematic analysis brought out that the participants wanted to be taken seriously in all aspects of life. Four themes emerged: ""Responsibility for risk-taking"", ""The influence of dependency"", ""Being treated as an employee"", and ""Maintaining optimism"". These men appreciated good information from health care providers, wanted to have more autonomy in decision-making and risk-taking - and did not wish to be patronized.

The Dutch reimbursement procedure for expensive drugs requires the submission of a baseline cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis and a research plan for the period of temporary reimbursement to estimate the real-life cost-effectiveness after 4 years. The Dutch guidelines recommend a value-of-information analysis to identify the critical parameters to be studied in such an outcome study. Objectives. Identify situations where sensitivity analyses are sufficient to establish the need for additional data collection and priority setting. Methods. We used a hypothetical Markov model with 3 groups of parameters. We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) and analyzed the expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI), for different configurations of input parameters and a range of threshold incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (l). We introduced a multivariate (deterministic) sensitivity analysis and a partial PSA. Results. Deterministic, partial PSA, and EVPPI analyses came to the same ranking of priorities for future research in most cases, irrespective of the place of the results on the CE plane. Rankings differed only when the statistical metrics that we calculated for each method were close together. Conclusions. When a clear ranking can be established, all methods lead to the same priority setting. If there is no clear ranking, we regard the parameters as equally important. Priority setting for future research depends on l and the location of results on the CE plane. The EVPPI is needed to estimate the value of doing additional research, but to prioritize parameters for further research, extensive (partial probabilistic) sensitivity analyses and expected value of perfect information are often sufficient.",decision analysis,Medical Informatics

Whereas patient care asks for experience, expertise and close supervision, medical training requires space to practise and the invisibility' of medical residents. Yet current reforms in postgraduate medical training point to an increasing emphasis on the measurable visibility of residents. Drawing on an ethnographic study of gynaecology training in The Netherlands, this article demonstrates that in daily clinical routines multiple practices of residents' visibility (visibilities) coexist. The article lists four visibilities: staging residents, negotiating supervision, playing the invisibility game and filming surgical operations. The article shows how attending physicians and medical residents tinker with these visibilities in daily clinical work to provide good care while enacting learning space, highlighting the increasing importance of visualising technologies in clinical work. Moreover, the article contributes to traditional sociological accounts on medical education, shifting the focus from medical education as a social institution to the practices of medical training itself. Such a focus on practice helps to gain an understanding of how the current reform challenges clinicians' educational activities.",medical technology,Sociology

Current initiatives are largely focussed on software. With the exception of diagnostic, prognostic, monitoring and treatment software, which are subject to medical device regulations in some countries, the safety of the most common types of HIT systems such as EHRs and CPOE without decision support is not being explicitly addressed in most nations. Appropriate mechanisms for safety assurance are required for the full range of HIT systems for health professionals and consumers including all software and hardware throughout the system lifecycle. In addition to greater standardisation and oversight to ensure safe system design and build, appropriate implementation and use of HIT is critical to ensure patient safety.

We present the method on an annually repeated cross-sectional data set, the Dutch Health Survey, covering years between 1981 and 2008. We applied generalized additive models for location, scale and shape semi-parametric regression models to estimate the probability distribution of BMI for each combination of age, gender and year assuming that BMI follows a BoxCox power exponential distribution. We modelled and extrapolated the distribution parameters as a function of age and calendar time using the LeeCarter model. The projected parameters defined future BMI distributions from which we derived the prevalence of normal weight, overweight and obesity. Our analysis showed that important changes occurred not only in the location and scale of the BMI distribution but also in the shape of it. The BMI distribution became flatter and more shifted to the right. Assuming that past trends in the distribution of BMI will continue in the future, we predicted a stable or slow increase in the prevalence of overweight until 2020 among men and women. We conclude that our adaptation of the LeeCarter model provides an insightful and flexible way of forecasting BMI and that ignoring changes in the shape of the BMI distribution would likely result in biased forecasts.

We elicited preferences for six health states and employed an intertemporal ranking task as a benchmark to test the validity of the two methods. We also tested constant proportional trade-offs (CPTO), while correcting for discounting, and the effect of extending the lead time if a health state is considered substantially WTD. LT-TTO produced lower values for BTD states and higher values for WTD states. The validity of CPTO varied across tasks, but it was higher for LT-TTO than for TTO. Results indicate that the ratio of lead time to disease time has a greater impact on results than the total duration of the time frame.

Therefore, complementing forecasts of life expectancy with forecasts of health expectancies is useful. To forecast health expectancy, an extension of the stochastic extrapolative models developed for forecasting total life expectancy could be applied, but instead of projecting total mortality and using regular life tables, one could project transition probabilities between health states simultaneously and use multistate life table methods. In this article, we present a theoretical framework for a multistate life table model in which the transition probabilities depend on age and calendar time. The goal of our study is to describe a model that projects transition probabilities by the Lee-Carter method, and to illustrate how it can be used to forecast future health expectancy with prediction intervals around the estimates. We applied the method to data on the Dutch population aged 55 and older, and projected transition probabilities until 2030 to obtain forecasts of life expectancy, disability-free life expectancy, and probability of compression of disability.",Health expectancy,Demography

Rotterdam, the second largest city in The Netherlands, has large inequalities in perinatal health and a high number of deprived neighbourhoods. Social deprivation is measured here through a composite variable: 'Social Index' (SI). We studied the impact of the SI (2008-2009; 5 categories) in terms of perinatal mortality, congenital anomalies, preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA) and low 5-minute Apgar score as registered in The Netherlands Perinatal Registry (Rotterdam 2000-2007, n = 56,443 singleton pregnancies). We applied ethnic dichotomisation as Western (European/North-American/Australian) vs. Non-Western (all others) ethnicity was expected to interact with the impact of SI. Tests for trend and multilevel regression analysis were applied. Gradually decreasing prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes was observed in Western women from the lowest SI category (low social quality) to the highest SI category (high social quality). In Western women the low-high SI gradient for prevalence of spontaneous preterm birth (per 1000) changed from 57.2 to 34.1, for iatrogenic preterm birth from 35.2 to 19.0, for SGA from 119.6 to 59.4, for low Apgar score from 10.9 to 8.2, and for perinatal mortality from 14.9 to 7.6. These trends were statistically confirmed by Chi2-tests for trend (p < 0.001). For non-Western women such trends were absent. These strong effects for Western women were confirmed by significant odds ratios for almost all adverse perinatal outcomes estimated from multilevel regression analysis. We conclude social deprivation to play a different role among Western vs. non-Western women. Our results suggest that improvements in social quality may improve perinatal outcomes in Western women, but alternative approaches may be necessary for non-Western groups. Suggested explanations for non-Western 'migrant' groups include the presence of 'protective' effects through knowledge systems or intrinsic resilience. Implications concern both general and targeted policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Urban health,Biomedical Social Sciences

In theory, health insurance competition can enhance efficiency in health care administration and delivery only if people have free choice of insurer (consumer mobility), if insurers do not have incentives to select risks, and if insurers are able to influence health service quality and costs. In practice, reforms in the four countries have not always prioritised efficiency and implementation has varied. Differences in policy goals explain some but not all of the differences in implementation. Despite significant investment in risk adjustment, incentives for risk selection remain and consumer mobility is not evenly distributed across the population. Better risk adjustment might make it easier for older and less healthy people to change insurer. Policy makers could also do more to prevent insurers from linking the sale of statutory and voluntary health insurance, particularly where take-up of voluntary coverage is widespread. Collective negotiation between insurers and providers in Belgium, Germany and Switzerland curbs insurers' ability to influence health care quality and costs. Nevertheless, while insurers in the Netherlands have good access to efficiency-enhancing tools, data and capacity constraints and resistance from stakeholders limit the extent to which tools are used. The experience of these countries offers an important lesson to other countries: it is not straightforward to put in place the conditions under which health insurance competition can enhance efficiency. Policy makers should not, therefore, underestimate the challenges involved. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Europe,Health Care Sciences & Services

Methods: Lung function outcomes and drug prices were observed for a UK COPD population over the period from 2001 to 2010. Cost-effectiveness was assessed at regular intervals on the basis of an established cost-effectiveness model, and the maximum price a technology providing cure could achieve under the current cost-effectiveness rules was estimated. Results: The results of this study show that although the scope for clinical improvement in COPD was still considerable, during the 10 years studied, the potential for cost-effectiveness at each point in time was dependent on momentary market characteristics, such as the changing price of comparators and improvements in clinical effectiveness. As a result, the analysis demonstrates that the future cost-effectiveness of a technology in development depends on the manner pricing and clinical effectiveness evolve throughout time. Conclusions: Because any predictions will be short-lived and dependent on a number of uncertain factors, we conclude that producing accurate forecasts on the potential for cost-effectiveness of new therapies earlier during the development process is especially difficult under the current static cost-effectiveness framework.",research and development,Health Care Sciences & Services

The study sample consisted of 106 professionals (of 244 individuals contacted) participating in 21 partnerships that implemented different innovative community care programmes in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Partnership functioning was evaluated by assessing leadership, resources administration and efficiency. Synergy was considered the proximal outcome of partnership functioning, which, in turn, influenced the achievement of programme sustainability. On a 5-point scale of increasing sustainability, mean sustainability scores ranged from 1.9 to 4.9. The results of the regression analysis demonstrated that sustainability was positively influenced by leadership (standardised regression coefficient beta = 0.32; P < 0.001) and non-financial resources (beta = 0.25; P = 0.008). No significant relationship was found between administration or efficiency and programme sustainability. Partnership synergy acted as a mediator for partnership functioning and significantly affected sustainability (beta = 0.39; P < 0.001). These findings suggest that the sustainability of innovative programmes in community care is achieved more readily when synergy is created between partners. Synergy was more likely to emerge with boundary-spanning leaders, who understood and appreciated partners different perspectives, and could bridge their diverse cultures and were comfortable sharing ideas, resources and power. In addition, the acknowledgement of and ability to use members resources were found to be valuable in engaging partners involvement and achieving synergy in community care partnerships.",synergy,Social Work

Evidence for the types of support neighbours provide to older people and how neighbours collaborate with formal support-givers is currently insufficient. Our study therefore explored (i) types of informal neighbour support and (ii) experiences of neighbours, volunteers and professionals providing support. Interviews with nine Dutch neighbour support-givers, five volunteers and 12 professionals were conducted and subjected to latent content analysis. Findings indicate that commitment occurred naturally among neighbours; along with providing instrumental and emotional support, neighbour support seems to be a matter of carefully watching over each other. Neighbour support-givers, however, are often frail themselves and become overburdened; they furthermore lack support from professionals. Neighbour, volunteer and professional support-givers seem to operate in distinct, non-collaborative spheres. Findings suggest that policy-makers should consider the opportunities and limitations of neighbour and volunteer support. Professionals have an indispensable role in providing back-up and accountable, specialised support. They may be trained to adopt a visible and proactive attitude in neighbourhoods to facilitate, cooperate with and mediate between neighbour and volunteer support-givers.",volunteer,Social Work

This article is a report of a study that identifies organizational characteristics explaining employee solidarity in the long-term care sector. Background. Employee solidarity reportedly improves organizations' effectiveness and efficiency. Although general research on solidarity in organizations is available, the impact of the organizational context on solidarity in long-term care settings is lacking. Design. Cross-sectional survey. Method. The study was carried out in Dutch long-term care. A total of 313 nurses, managers and other care professionals in 23 organizations were involved. Organizational characteristics studied were centralization, hierarchical culture, formal and informal exchange of information and leadership style. The study was carried out in 2009. Findings. All organizational characteristics significantly correlated with employee solidarity in the univariate analyses. In the multivariate analyses hierarchical culture, centralization, exchange of formal and informal information and transformational leadership appears to be important for solidarity among nurses, managers and other professionals in long-term care organizations, but not transactional and passive leadership styles. Conclusion. The study increased our knowledge of solidarity among nurses, managers and other professionals in the long-term care settings. Organizational characteristics that enhance solidarity are high levels of formal and informal information exchange, less hierarchical authority, decentralization and transformational leadership styles.",solidarity,Nursing

Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) calculations in economic evaluations are typically based on general public or patient health state valuations elicited with the time tradeoff method (TTO). Such health state valuations elicited among the general public have been shown to be affected by respondents' subjective life expectancy (SLE). This suggests that TTO exercises based on time frames other than SLE may lead to biased estimates. It has not yet been investigated whether SLE also affects patient valuations. Objective. To empirically investigate whether patients' SLE affects TTO valuations of their current health state. Methods. Patients with different severities of diabetic retinopathy were asked in a telephone interview to value their own health status using TTO. The TTO time frame (t) presented was based on age- and sex-dependent actuarial life expectancy. Patients were then asked to state their SLE. Simple and multiple regression techniques were used to assess the effect of the patients' SLE on their TTO responses. Results. In total, 145 patients completed the telephone interview. Patients' TTO values were significantly influenced by their SLE. The TTO value decreased linearly with every additional year of difference between t and the patients' SLE; that is, patients were more willing to give up years the shorter their SLE compared with t. Conclusion. Patients' SLE influenced their TTO valuations, suggesting that respondents' SLE may be the most appropriate time frame to use in TTO exercises in patients. The use of other time periods may bias the TTO valuations, as the respondents may experience the presented time frame as a gain or a loss. The effect seems to be larger in patient valuations than in general public valuations.",QALYs,Medical Informatics

Design and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 945 of 1,440 (66% response rate) independently living older adults (aged >= 70 years) in Rotterdam. We fitted a hierarchical random effects model to account for the hierarchical structure of the study design: 945 older adults (Level 1) nested in 72 neighborhoods (Level 2). Results: Univariate analyses showed that being born in the Netherlands, house ownership, education, income, social capital of individuals, neighborhood security, neighborhood services, neighborhood social capital, and neighborhood social cohesion were significantly related to the well being of older adults. Multilevel analyses showed that social capital of individuals, neighborhood services, neighborhood social capital, and neighborhood social cohesion predicted the well being of older adults. Single and poor older adults reported lower well being than did better off and married older adults. However, the effects of marital status and income were mediated by neighborhood services, social capital, and social cohesion. Neighborhood services, social capital, and social cohesion may act as buffer against the adverse effects of being single and poor on the well being of older adults. Implications: The results of this study support the importance of social capital of individuals, as well as social capital within the neighborhood and social cohesion within the neighborhood for well being of older adults. The well being of older adults may also be enhanced through the improvement of quality of neighborhood services.",Multilevel analyses,Geriatrics & Gerontology

A better, in-depth, understanding of the content and complexities of quality improvement is necessary because of the still limited theoretical and empirical grounds underlying its approach. This article draws on empirical material from Care for Better, a national quality improvement collaborative (QIC) for the long-term care sector in the Netherlands that took place from 2005 until 2012. Following a project on prevention of malnutrition, we analyzed the complex and ongoing processes of embedding improvements. The guiding question for our research was: what must be accomplished to enable and sustain improvements to occur in the everyday life of care organizations? In our analysis, we linked ethnographic findings to Actor Network Theory. We found that different kinds of work had to be done by both human and non-human actors to displace improvements into specific organizational situations. We conceptualized this work as the activity of translation. Moreover, the concept of inscription offers a perspective to reveal how improvements are made durable. Inscriptions are translations of values into texts, behavior or materialities that steer action in a specific way. We analyzed three different modes of inscription: gathering, materializing and training. We analyzed how one specific value, patient choice, became inscribed in different ways, configuring the actors in specific ways, with diverging consequences for how patient choice comes about.

To systematically incorporate societal preferences into these evaluations, quality-adjusted life year gains could be weighted according to some equity principle, the most suitable of which is a matter of frequent debate. While many countries still struggle with equity concerns for priority setting in health care, the Netherlands has reached a broad consensus to use the concept of proportional shortfall. Our study evaluates the concept and its support in the Dutch health care context. We discuss arguments in the Netherlands for using proportional shortfall and difficulties in transitioning from principle to practice. In doing so, we address universal issues leading to a systematic consideration of equity concerns for priority setting in health care.

Delegation gives individuals the chance to practice exit/choice or voice without all the hard work that is usually involved in these options. Empirical research shows that not many people use their individual options of exit and voice, which could lead to inequality between users and nonusers. We identify delegation as a possible solution to this problem, using Dutch health care as a case study to explore this option. Notwithstanding various advantages, we show that voice and choice by delegation also entail problems of inequality and representativeness.",,Biomedical Social Sciences

Demonstration of their real-world costs and cost-effectiveness is often required for reimbursement. However, few published economic evaluations of novel agents for multiple myeloma exist. Moreover, existing cost analyses were heavily based on conventionally treated patients. We investigated real-world health care costs of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in Dutch daily practice. Methods: A retrospective medical chart review was conducted for 139 patients treated between January 2001 and May 2009. Total monthly costs attributable to each cost component were described across all regimens and for bortezomib-, thalidomide- and lenalidomide-based treatment regimens. Results: Mean monthly total costs ((sic)3,981) varied depending on the sequence of therapy (range: (sic)442(sic)31,318). Significant cost drivers across all regimens included costs of therapy and hospital admissions. The acquisition costs for novel agents in particular accounted for 32% of mean total monthly costs. Prognostic factors associated with increased mean total monthly costs in multivariate regression analysis included low platelet counts (P = 0.01) and worsening performance status (P < 0.001). Mean total monthly costs of bortezomib- and lenalidomide-based regimens were significantly higher than those for thalidomide-based regimens in second, third and fourth treatment line. What is new and conclusions: Real-world costs during treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma vary greatly. Cost drivers include hospital admissions and acquisition costs of novel agents.

The adequate delivery of the intervention components strongly depended on various moderating factors. Since the intervention is still developing and undergoing continuous modifications, it has been concluded that the fidelity criteria should evolve with the modified intervention. Furthermore, repeated intervention fidelity assessments will be necessary to ensure a valid and reliable fidelity assessment of the PReCaP.",Moderating factors,Health Care Sciences & Services

The authors analyze how the employment of databases by collectives of physicians and researchers shape both clinical and policy practice-and thereby reshape the relation between clinical work and policy. Since the late 1990s, Dutch government has supported the development of clinical databases for specific expensive medicines to gain oversight about actual medicine use. To be able to produce evidence for appropriate medicine use, the collectives set regulations in clinical practice. These internal regulations provide a framework for establishing ""appropriate medicine use"", steering reimbursement decisions. However, internal regulation and policy rules differ in how quickly they can change. While the employment of databases in clinical practices results in a constant adjustment of the protocols, policy makers require the databases to provide for static moments of ""proven appropriate medicine use"" in order to account for and define a fixed and closed formulary. Subsequently, the employment of the databases did not deliver on the promise of oversight and control due to different clinical and policy requirements. Nevertheless, the databases did stimulate appropriate medicine use and reimbursement in clinical practice.",databases,Social Issues

The objective of this paper was to review past and current developments related to the inclusion, identification, measurement and valuation of productivity costs in economic evaluations. The main debates in the theory and practice of economic evaluations of health technologies described in this review have centred on the questions of whether and how to include productivity costs, especially productivity costs related to paid work. The past few decades have seen important progress in this area. There are important sources of productivity costs other than absenteeism (e.g. presenteeism and multiplier effects in co-workers), but their exact influence on costs remains unclear. Different measurement instruments have been developed over the years, but which instrument provides the most accurate estimates has not been established. Several valuation approaches have been proposed. While empirical research suggests that productivity costs are best included in the cost side of the cost-effectiveness ratio, the jury is still out regarding whether the human capital approach or the friction cost approach is the most appropriate valuation method to do so. Despite the progress and the substantial amount of scientific research, a consensus has not been reached on either the inclusion of productivity costs in economic evaluations or the methods used to produce productivity cost estimates. Such a lack of consensus has likely contributed to ignoring productivity costs in actual economic evaluations and is reflected in variations in national health economic guidelines. Further research is needed to lessen the controversy regarding the estimation of health-related productivity costs. More standardization would increase the comparability and credibility of economic evaluations taking a societal perspective.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Such broader nonhealth outcomes are usually neglected in economic evaluation studies. To allow for their consideration, insights are needed into the types of nonhealth outcomes that HP interventions produce and their relative importance compared with health outcomes. This study explored consumer preferences for health and nonhealth outcomes of HP in the context of lifestyle behavior change. Methods: A discrete choice experiment was conducted among participants in a lifestyle intervention (n = 132) and controls (n = 141). Respondents made 16 binary choices between situations that can be experienced after lifestyle behavior change. The situations were described by 10 attributes: future health state value, start point of future health state, life expectancy, clothing size above ideal, days with sufficient relaxation, endurance, experienced control over lifestyle choices, lifestyle improvement of partner and/or children, monetary cost per month, and time cost per week. Results: With the exception of ""time cost per week"" and ""start point of future health state,"" all attributes significantly determined consumer choices. Thus, both health and nonhealth outcomes affected consumer choice. Marginal rates of substitution between the price attribute and the other attributes revealed that the attributes ""endurance,"" ""days with sufficient relaxation,"" and ""future health state value"" had the greatest impact on consumer choices. The ""life expectancy"" attribute had a relatively low impact and for increases of less than 3 years, respondents were not willing to trade. Conclusions: Health outcomes and nonhealth outcomes of lifestyle behavior change were both important to consumers in this study. Decision makers should respond to consumer preferences and consider nonhealth outcomes when deciding about HP interventions.",nonhealth outcomes,Health Care Sciences & Services

This reflects the assumption that ""a QALY is a QALY"" no matter who receives it, or the equity notion that all QALY gains are equally valuable, regardless of the context in which they are realized. If such an assumption does not adequately reflect the distributional concerns in society, however, different thresholds could be used for different QALY gains, whose relative values can be seen as ""equity weights."" Aim: Our aim was to explore the relationship between equity or distributional concerns and the social value of QALYs within the health economics literature. In light of the empirical interest in equity-related concerns as well as the nature and height of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold, this study investigates the ""common ground"" between the two streams of literature and considers how the empirical literature estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold treats existing distributional considerations.",WTP,Health Care Sciences & Services

Moreover, it aims to explore how compensation and multiplier effects potentially affect productivity cost estimates. Absenteeism and compensation mechanisms were measured in a randomized trial among Dutch citizens examining the cost-effectiveness of reimbursement for smoking cessation treatment. Multiplier effects were extracted from published literature. Productivity costs were calculated applying the Friction Cost Approach. Regular estimates were subsequently adjusted for (i) compensation during regular working hours, (ii) job dependent multipliers and (iii) both compensation and multiplier effects. A total of 187 respondents included in the trial were useful for inclusion in this study, based on being in paid employment, having experienced absenteeism in the preceding six months and completing the questionnaire on absenteeism and compensation mechanisms. Over half of these respondents stated that their absenteeism was compensated during normal working hours by themselves or colleagues. Only counting productivity costs not compensated in regular working hours reduced the traditional estimate by 57%. Correcting for multiplier effects increased regular estimates by a quarter. Combining both impacts decreased traditional estimates by 29%. To conclude, large amounts of lost production are compensated in normal hours. Productivity costs estimates are strongly influenced by adjustment for compensation mechanisms and multiplier effects. The validity of such adjustments needs further examination, however.

Despite the fact that parents overall valued oral health for their child highly, still 12% of the parents were unwilling to spend any money, nor to invest any time by brushing their children's teeth to maintain good oral health for their child. Additionally, they indicated that they were unwilling to visit the dentist for preventive measures more than once a year. These children may certainly be considered at higher risk of developing oral diseases because worse oral hygiene habits and dietary habits were found in this group.

The role of nutrition in health maintenance and in the prevention of non-communicable diseases is now generally recognised. However, the main scope of those seeking to contain healthcare expenditures tends to focus on the management of existing chronic diseases. Identifying additional relevant dimensions to measure and the context of use will become increasingly important in selecting and developing outcome measurements for nutrition interventions. The translation of nutrition-related research data into public health guidance raises the challenging issue of carrying out more pragmatic trials in many areas where these would generate the most useful evidence for health policy decision-making. Nutrition exemplifies all the types of interventions and policy which need evaluating across the health field. There is a need to start actively engaging key stakeholders in order to collect data and to widen health technology assessment approaches for achieving a policy shift from evidence-based medicine to evidence-based decision-making in the field of nutrition.",Public health guidance,Nutrition & Dietetics

We investigate the financial burden of NCD vs. communicable diseases (CD) among rural poor in India and assess whether they can afford to treat NCD. Methods We used data from two household surveys undertaken in 20092010 among 7389 rural poor households (39 205 individuals) in Odisha and Bihar. All persons from the sampled households, irrespective of age and gender, were included in the analysis. We classify self-reported illnesses as NCD, CD or other morbidities following the WHO classification. Results Non-communicable diseases accounted for around 20% of the diseases in the month preceding the survey in Odisha and 30% in Bihar. The most prevalent NCD, representing the highest share in outpatient costs, were musculoskeletal, digestive and cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular and digestive problems also generated the highest inpatient costs. Women, older persons and less-poor households reported higher prevalence of NCD. Outpatient costs (consultations, medicines, laboratory tests and imaging) represented a bigger share of income for NCD than for CD. Patients with NCD were more likely to report a hospitalisation. Conclusion Patients with NCD in rural poor settings in India pay considerably more than patients with CD. For NCD cases that are chronic, with recurring costs, this would be aggravated. The cost of NCD care consumes a big part of the per person share of household income, obliging patients with NCD to rely on informal intra-family cross-subsidisation. An alternative solution to finance NCD care for rural poor patients is needed.",poblacion con ingresos bajos,Tropical Medicine

Because many risk factors are related to a variety of chronic diseases, these Markov models potentially contain a large number of states (risk factor and disease combinations), providing a challenge both technically (keeping down execution time and memory use) and practically (estimating the model parameters and retaining transparency). To meet this challenge, we propose an approach that combines micro-simulation of the exposure information with macro-simulation of the diseases and survival. This approach allows users to simulate exposure in detail while avoiding the need for large simulated populations because of the relative rareness of chronic disease events. Further efficiency is gained by splitting the disease state space into smaller spaces, each of which contains a cluster of diseases that is independent of the other clusters. The challenge of feasible input data requirements is met by including parameter calculation routines, which use marginal population data to estimate the transitions between states. As an illustration, we present the recently developed model DYNAMO-HIA (DYNAMIC MODEL for Health Impact Assessment) that implements this approach.",Chronic disease modeling,Demography

This causes researchers to ignore potentially useful past evidence when developing a novel prediction model with individual participant data (IPD) from their population of interest. We aimed to evaluate approaches to aggregate previously published prediction models with new data. We consider the situation that models are reported in the literature with predictors similar to those available in an IPD dataset. We adopt a two-stage method and explore three approaches to calculate a synthesis model, hereby relying on the principles of multivariate meta-analysis. The former approach employs a naive pooling strategy, whereas the latter accounts for within-study and between-study covariance. These approaches are applied to a collection of 15 datasets of patients with traumatic brain injury, and to five previously published models for predicting deep venous thrombosis. Here, we illustrated how the generally unrealistic assumption of consistency in the availability of evidence across included studies can be relaxed. Results from the case studies demonstrate that aggregation yields prediction models with an improved discrimination and calibration in a vast majority of scenarios, and result in equivalent performance (compared with the standard approach) in a small minority of situations. The proposed aggregation approaches are particularly useful when few participant data are at hand. Assessing the degree of heterogeneity between IPD and literature findings remains crucial to determine the optimal approach in aggregating previous evidence into new prediction models.

This article is concerned with how this approach relates to other modes of conceptualising patient safety. Following the work of Georges Canguilhem, I argue that, depending on how we conceptualise knowing, acting and error, a different mode of patient safety is possible: one that involves 'living with uncertainty'. Through ethnographic research on daily clinical work in Dutch primary care facilities, I show that the assumption that clinical work can be made safe by reducing errors not only is problematic, it also creates new forms of 'unsafety'. My observations at general practitioners' out-of-hours service units and other primary care facilities display a 'continuous stream of knowing and acting' in which care professionals adopt specific practices that avoid contradictions between uncertainty and safety. Although these practices differed in the various locations I studied, there were some common dimensions of 'living with uncertainty'. By problematising the conceptions of safety and errors as antonyms I suggest that a reappraisal is in order, particularly of the notion of errors in healthcare. Keeping and protecting room for errors in a situated way is crucial for knowing and acting in a field riddled with uncertainty and dealing with human life.",uncertainty,History & Philosophy of Science

Based on construal level theory, one would expect that consumers cognitively represent the individual and collective outcomes of an allocation policy at different levels of abstraction and that they evaluate allocation policies more positively when there is congruency between the cognitive representation of the policy's focal outcome and the spatial and temporal distance inherently present in the policy's decision context (e.g., allocation decisions on a future policy). However, we hypothesize that this congruency effect can be overruled by a high vested interest mindset that is activated by an individual's recent personal experience with a health care service provider. Since a high vested interest mindset increases the relevance of the allocation policy implementation for the individual because s/he perceives strong personal consequences, we propose that for consumers with recent experience the evaluation of an allocation policy that focuses on individual outcomes is higher than that of a policy that focuses on collective outcomes irrespective of the spatial and temporal distance in the decision context. Results of a hypothetical experiment among a representative sample of the general population confirm the congruency effects in the new domain of health care service allocation policies, and provide support for the proposed overruling effect of the activation of a high vested interest mindset by recent personal experience on spatial and temporal distance.",Consumer decision making,Business & Economics

Methods: This was an observational study using data from electronic antenatal charts of 7 midwife practices (23 midwives), participating in the Generation R Study. The Generation R Study is a multiethnic, population-based, prospective, cohort study that is investigating the growth, development, and health of urban children from fetal life until young adulthood. The study is conducted in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The antenatal charts of 2093 low-risk pregnant women with an expected birthing date in 2002 through 2004 were used to determine the mean quality of antenatal care scores for 7 ethnic groups. These scores reflected the degree of adherence to the guidelines regarding 10 tests and examinations. Results: Few differences between ethnic groups were found in adherence to the guidelines that addressed the obstetric-technical quality of antenatal care. This finding applied more to nulliparous than to multiparous women. Adherence to guidelines was not always better in the antenatal care provided to native Dutch multiparous women when compared to other ethnic groups. Midwives adhered well to the guidelines regarding most tests. For all women, irrespective of ethnic background, hemoglobin was not measured as often as recommended, and this was especially the case for Moroccan, Surinamese-Creole, and Dutch-Antillean multiparous women. Discussion: The poorer adherence regarding screening for hemoglobin needs further investigation, as women with African or Mediterranean heritage are more at risk for hemoglobinopathies. However, in general, midwives adhered well to the clinical guidelines regarding most tests irrespective of the ethnic background of the pregnant women. When differences were present, these were not systematically less favorable for non-Dutch pregnant women.",quality of care,Nursing

Other aspects for improving reliability like the training of raters seem to receive less notice. It is worth asking whether this technical approach could be complemented by training the user of the instrument. A systematic meta-analytical review of the research literature was performed to answer this question and examine the effectiveness of planned interventions for improving interrater reliability of health care professionals. Method The databases of PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, Omega and PsycINFO were searched. The inclusion criteria were met by 57 studies. Details extracted from the studies included the study design, the number of observers and the number of observed cases, the intervention, the type of instrument (whether or not it was highly technical), and statistical information about the agreement before and after the intervention. Interventions were categorized into three groups: training of professionals, improving the diagnostic instrument and a combination of training and improving the instrument. A meta-analysis was performed by means of linear regression. Results The interventions were arranged according to their effectiveness in improving the diagnostic instrument (mean change: beta = 0.13), training combined with improving the instrument (mean change: beta = 0.10) and training (mean change: beta = 0.09). Conclusion On average, although all types of interventions are effective, improving the diagnostic instrument seems to be the most effective. Especially when highly technical instruments were concerned, improvement proved to be very effective (beta = 0.52). Because instrumental variables constitute a major source of error, improving the instrument is an important approach. However, this review offers solid arguments that can complement the literature and practice, with a focus on training the user of the instrument.",regulation,General & Internal Medicine

Many of these indicators were initially developed and implemented in the USA. However, the suitability of directly adopting indicators that have been developed in a different health care system can be questioned. Therefore, we investigate the validity behind the readmission rate indicator in the European setting. Methods: A systematic literature study was conducted to identify the status of scientific research on the validity of this indicator (January 1999 and April 2010). Descriptive information as well as information on the data source, indicator definition, risk adjustment factors, and conclusions was assessed. Results: The majority of the 486 included studies focused on the actual use of the indicator as an outcome measure in European countries. Only 21 studies specifically addressed its validity, or important prerequisites of validity. There is little consensus over the time-frame used to calculate the indicator, the type of readmission that is included, and the case-mix adjustment applied. Conclusions: Despite the increase in Europe of the use of the readmission rate as a measure of quality of care, the amount of research performed on its validity is scarce. Those studies that report on validity replicate earlier, mainly US findings (< 1999) of methodological problems and express reservations on its large-scale use. The readmission rate as an indicator should be used with care. Users should address issues related to definition, time-frame and case-mix adjustment as part of the process to enhance validity in the European settings.",,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

An elaborate test of procedural invariance of TTO, using a choice-based design","The time tradeoff (TTO) method is often used to derive Quality-Adjusted Life Year health state valuations. An important problem with this method is that results have been found to be responsive to the procedure used to elicit preferences. In particular, fixing the duration in the health state to be valued and inferring the duration in full health that renders an individual indifferent, causes valuations to be higher than when the duration in full health is fixed and the duration in the health state to be valued is elicited. This paper presents a new test of procedural invariance for a broad range of time horizons, while using a choice-based design and adjusting for discounting. As one of the known problems with the conventional procedure is the violation of constant proportional tradeoffs (CPTO), we also investigate CPTO for the alternative TTO procedure. Our findings concerning procedural invariance are rather supportive for the TTO procedure. We find no violations of procedural invariance except for the shortest gauge duration. The results for CPTO are more troublesome: TTO scores depend on gauge duration, reinforcing the evidence reported when using the conventional procedure.",Time tradeoff method,Health Care Sciences & Services

Greater attention to human factors and usability during development of a medical device could improve this situation. However, recent studies have shown that companies do not find the application of a sound usability engineering process according to international standards a simple task. The purpose of this collaborative research project between a medical device company, two universities and a university hospital was to study the practical application of the International Standard for Application of Usability Engineering to Medical Devices, IEC 62366, by means of a case study in industrial practice. This paper describes the user studies in the case and reveals the factors important to success. Also, the paper demonstrates how to apply an iterative usability engineering process within a linear product development process in industry. Management support and careful planning of resources and activities proved essential. To control use-related risks, the usability engineer should 'design for risk control' in a structured manner, while the risk manager should remain responsible for acceptable levels of residual risk.

In settings with severely constrained health resources, there is a need to spend money wisely. To achieve this and to guide policy makers in their selection of interventions, this study systematically compares costs and effects of breast cancer control interventions in Ghana. Methods We used a mathematical model to estimate costs and health effects of breast cancer interventions in Ghana from the healthcare perspective. Analyses were based on the WHO-CHOICE method, with health effects expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), costs in 2009 US dollars (US$) and cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) in US$ per DALY averted. Analyses were based on local demographic, epidemiological and economic data, to the extent these data were available. Results Biennial screening by clinical breast examination (CBE) of women aged 4069 years, in combination with treatment of all stages, seems the most cost-effective intervention (costing $1299 per DALY averted). The intervention is also economically attractive according to international standards on cost-effectiveness. Mass media awareness raising (MAR) is the second best option (costing $1364 per DALY averted). Mammography screening of women of aged 4069 years (costing $12 908 per DALY averted) cannot be considered cost-effective. Conclusions Both CBE screening and MAR seem economically attractive interventions. Given the uncertainty about the effectiveness of these interventions, only their phased introduction, carefully monitored and evaluated, is warranted. Moreover, their implementation is only meaningful if the capacity of basic cancer diagnostic, referral and treatment and possibly palliative services is simultaneously improved.",enfermedades no contagiosas,Tropical Medicine

We mapped QLQC30, HAQ, and MSIS-29 on the EQ-5D and compared the quality of the mapping functions with statistical and clinical indicators. Methods. We used 4 data sets that included both the EQ-5D and a condition-specific measure to develop ordinary least squares regression equations. For the QLQ-C30, we used a multiple myeloma data set and a non-Hodgkin lymphoma one. An early arthritis cohort was used for the HAQ, and a cohort of patients with relapsing remitting or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was used for the MSIS-29. We assessed the predictive quality of the mapping functions with the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) and the ability to discriminate among relevant clinical subgroups. Pearson correlations between the condition-specific measures and items of the EQ-5D were used to determine if there is a relationship between the quality of the mapping functions and the amount of correlated content between the used measures. Results. The QLQ-C30 had the highest correlation with EQ-5D items. Average % RMSE was best for the QLQ-C30 with 10.9%, 12.2% for the HAQ, and 13.6% for the MSIS-29. The mappings predicted mean EQ-5D utilities without significant differences with observed utilities and discriminated between relevant clinical groups, except for the HAQ model. Conclusions. The preferred mapping functions in this study seem suitable for estimating EQ-5D utilities for economic evaluation. However, this research shows that lower correlations between instruments lead to less predictive quality. Using additional validation tests besides reporting statistical measures of error improves the assessment of predictive quality.",validation,Medical Informatics

In the hospital industry, however, the standard method for defining the relevant market (SSNIP) is difficult to apply and alternative approaches have proven inaccurate. Experiences from the United States show that courts, by identifying overly broad geographic markets, have underestimated the anticompetitive effects of hospital mergers. We examine how geographic hospital markets are defined in Germany and the Netherlands where market-oriented reforms have created room for hospital competition. For each country, we discuss a landmark case where definition of the geographic market played a decisive role. Our findings indicate that defining geographic hospital markets in both countries is less complicated than in the United States, where antitrust analysis must take managed care organisations into account. We also find that different methods result in much more stringent hospital merger control in Germany than in the Netherlands. Given the uncertainties in defining hospital markets, the German competition authority seems to be inclined to avoid the risk of being too permissive; the opposite holds for the Dutch competition authority. We argue that for society the costs of being too permissive with regard to hospital mergers may be larger than the costs of being too stringent.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

The measurement of these two factors is complicated because they interact. Existing methods either simply assume one factor given, based on heuristic assumptions, or invoke complicating extraneous factors, such as risk, that generate extra biases. The authors introduce a method for measuring discounting (and then quality of life) that involves no extraneous factors and that avoids distorting interactions. Their method is considerably simpler and more realistic for subjects than existing methods. It is entirely choice based and thus can be founded on economic rationality requirements. An experiment demonstrates the feasibility of this method and its advantages over classical methods.",time tradeoff,Medical Informatics

Yet, there is little guidance on how individual-specific preferences and cost data can be combined to inform health care decisions about customized care. Therefore, we propose a discrete choice experiment-based approach that illustrates how to analyze the cost-effectiveness of customized (and noncustomized) care programs to provide information for hospital managers. Methods: We exploit the fact that choice models make it possible to determine whether preference heterogeneity exists and to obtain individual-specific parameter estimates. We present an approach of how to combine these individual-specific parameter estimates from a random parameter model (mixed logit model) with cost data to analyze the cost-effectiveness of customized care and demonstrate our method in the case of follow-up after breast cancer treatment. Results: We found that there is significant preference heterogeneity for all except two attributes of breast cancer treatment follow-up and that the fully customized care program leads to higher utility and lower costs than the current standardized program. Compared with the single alternative program, the fully customized care program has increased benefits and higher costs. Thus, it is necessary for health care decision makers to judge whether the use of resources for customized care is cost-effective. Conclusions: Decision makers should consider using the results obtained from our methodological approach when they consider implementing customized health care programs, because it may help to find ways to save costs and increase patient satisfaction.",preference heterogeneity,Health Care Sciences & Services

The objective of this study was to develop values sets for the EQ-5D-5L by means of a mapping (""cross-walk"") approach to the currently available three-level version of the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) values sets. Methods: The EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L descriptive systems were coadministered to respondents with conditions of varying severity to ensure a broad range of levels of health across EQ-5D questionnaire dimensions. We explored four models to generate value sets for the EQ-5D-5L: linear regression, nonparametric statistics, ordered logistic regression, and item-response theory. Criteria for the preferred model included theoretical background, statistical fit, predictive power, and parsimony. Results: A total of 3691 respondents were included. All models had similar fit statistics. Predictive power was slightly better for the nonparametric and ordered logistic regression models. In considering all criteria, the nonparametric model was selected as most suitable for generating values for the EQ-5D-5L. Conclusions: The nonparametric model was preferred for its simplicity while performing similarly to the other models. Being independent of the value set that is used, it can be applied to transform any EQ-5D-3L value set into EQ-5D-5L index values. Strengths of this approach include compatibility with three-level value sets. A limitation of any crosswalk is that the range of index values is restricted to the range of the EQ-5D-3L value sets.",utilities,Health Care Sciences & Services

It indicates that general HRQoL measures, as used in patients, may be able to detect HRQoL effects in caregivers, which facilitates the incorporation in common economic evaluations of HRQoL effects in carers.

In both countries the medical training regime has shifted from professional self-regulation to coregulation. Yet there are notable differences in each country that cannot be explained solely by diverging institutional contexts. They also result from the strategic actions by the actors involved. Based on an assessment of the recent literature on institutional transformation, this article shows how strategic actions set negotiating authority processes into motion, producing new and sometimes surprising institutional arrangements that can have profound effects on the distribution and allocation of authority in the medical training regime.

The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of CRPS1 in patients with a fracture using 3 sets of diagnostic criteria and to evaluate the association between demographic/medical factors and the development of CRPS1 diagnosed with the Harden and Bruehl criteria. A prospective multicenter cohort study of 596 patients (ages 18 years and older) with a single fracture of the wrist, scaphoid, ankle, or metatarsal V, recruited patients from the emergency rooms of 3 Dutch hospitals. Of the 596 participants, 42 (7.0%) were diagnosed with CRPS1 according to the Harden and Bruehl criteria, 289 (48.5%) according to the International Association for the Study of Pain criteria, and 127 (21.3%) according to the criteria of Veldman. An analysis of the medical and demographic differences revealed that patients in whom CRPS1 later developed more often had intra-articular fractures, fracture dislocations, rheumatoid arthritis, or musculoskeletal comorbidities. An ankle fracture, dislocation, and an intra-articular fracture contributed significantly to the prediction of the development of CRPS1. No CRPS1 patients were symptom free at 12 months (T3). At baseline, patients with CRPS1 had significantly more pain than patients without CRPS1 (P<.001). The incidence of the diagnosis of CRPS1 after a single fracture depends to a large extent on the diagnostic criteria used. After a fracture, 7% of the patients developed CRPS1 and none of the patients were free of symptoms at 1-year follow-up. (C) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Several authors stress that enhancing the organizations' and caregivers' reflexivity allows for more situated, and therefore better care. Within quality improvement initiatives, devices that guarantee quality are also seen as key to the delivery of good care. These devices do not solely aim at standardizing work practices, but are also of importance in facilitating reflexivity. In this article, we study how quality improvement devices position the relationship between situated reflection and standardization of work processes. By exploring the work of Michel Callon, Michael Lynch, and Lucy Suchman on reflexivity in work practices, we study the development and introduction of the Care Living Plan. This device aimed to transform care organizations of older people from their orientation towards the system of care into organizations that take a client-centred approach. Our analysis of the construction of specific forms of reflexivity in quality devices indicates that the question of reflexivity does not need to be opposed to standardization and needs to be addressed not only at the level of where reflexivity is organizationally situated and who gets to do the reflecting, but also on the content of reflexivity, such as what are the issues that care workers can and cannot reflect upon. In this paper we point out the theoretical importance of a more detailed empirical study of the framing of reflexivity in care practices.",Quality improvement devices,Biomedical Social Sciences

We now focus on CVD mortality by specific country of birth across European countries. Methods: For Denmark, England and Wales, France, The Netherlands, Scotland and Sweden mortality information on circulatory disease, and the subcategories of ischaemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease, was analysed by country of birth. Information on population was obtained from census data or population registers. Directly age-standardized rates per 100 000 were estimated by sex for each country of birth group using the WHO World Standard population 2000-25 structure.

To overcome this problem, new condition-specific PBMs (CS-PBMs) are being developed, but it is not yet clear how such measures compare with existing generic PBMs. Method: We generated CS-PBMs from three condition-specific questionnaires (Health Assessment Questionnaire for arthritis, Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer 30 for cancer, and Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale 29 for multiple sclerosis). First, the questionnaires were reduced in content, and then, a time trade-off study was conducted in the general public (N = 402) to obtain weights associated with the dimensions and levels of the new questionnaire. Finally, we compared utilities obtained by using the CS-PBMs with utilities obtained by using the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire in four data sets. Results: Utility values generated by the CS-PBMs were higher than those of the EQ-5D questionnaire. The Health Assessment Questionnaire-based measure for arthritis proved to be insensitive to comorbidities. Measures based on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale 29 and the Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer 30 discriminated comorbidities and side effect equally well as the EQ-5D questionnaire and were more sensitive than the EQ-5D questionnaire for mild impairments. Conclusions: The introduction of PBMs that are specific to a certain disease may have the merit of sensitivity to disease- specific effects of interventions. That gain, however, is traded off to the loss of comparability of utility values and, in some cases, insensitivity to side effects and comorbidity.

How to weigh future health effects has resulted in ongoing discussions. These discussions are imminently relevant for health care interventions with current costs but future benefits. Different approaches to discount health effects have been proposed. In this study, we estimated the impact of different approaches for discounting health benefits of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Methods: An HPV model was used to estimate the impact of different discounting approaches on the present value of health effects. For the constant discount approaches, we varied the discount rate for health effects ranging from 0% to 4%. Next, the impact of relevant alternative discounting approaches was estimated, including hyperbolic, proportional, stepwise, and time-shifted discounting. Results: The present value of health effects gained through HPV vaccination varied strongly when varying discount rates and approaches. The application of the current Dutch guidelines resulted in a present value of health effects that was eight or two times higher than that produced when using the proportional discounting approach or when using the internationally more common 4% discount rate for health effects, respectively. Obviously, such differences translate into large variations in corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Conclusion: The exact discount rate and approach chosen in an economic evaluation importantly impact the projected value of health benefits of HPV vaccination.

The commentary is based on a report, which includes a structured analysis of 79 projects funded by ZonMW, a survey of published implementation research covering 141 systematic reviews, and qualitative study of the implementation infrastructure in the Netherlands. Five themes were identified. First, the term 'knowledge implementation' may be better replaced by more specific terms in some situations. Second, contextual factors need to be taken more systematically into account when planning and evaluating implementation programs. Third, knowledge may change when implemented and this needs to be considered in projects. Fourth, we observed that implementation has developed into a specific world, separated from both healthcare practice and scientific research. It is important to guard against the risk of isolation from the practical and societal needs that the field is meant to address. Finally, we suggest that the strong focus on 'doing projects' and limited opportunities for structural funding may reduce substantial improvement in the field. Many good activities are underway, but the policies regarding knowledge implementation appear to need some adjustment. In its policy plan for the coming years, ZonMW has partly taken up the lessons from our advisory report.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

This paper uses community and individual-level longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey to estimate the net health impact of China's unprecedented urbanization. We construct an index of urbanicity from a broad set of community characteristics and define urbanization in terms of movements across the distribution of this index. We use difference-in-differences estimators to identify the treatment effect of urbanization on the self-assessed health of individuals. We find that urbanization raises the probability of reporting of poor health and that a greater degree of urbanization has a larger effect. The effect may, in part, be attributable to changed health expectations, but it also appears to operate through health behaviour.

Important criteria in that framework are 'necessity' and 'cost-effectiveness'. Several normative choices need to be made, and these choices can have an important impact on the evaluation of lifestyle interventions, especially when making these criteria operational and quantifiable.

Methods: From 2005 until 2008 an economic evaluation was performed alongside a pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing UI patients receiving care by nurse specialists with patients receiving care-as-usual by GPs in the Netherlands. One hundred eighty-six adult patients with stress, urgency, or mixed UI were randomly allocated to the intervention and 198 to care-as-usual; they were followed for 1 year. Main outcome measures were Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALYsocietal) based on societal preferences for health outcomes (EuroQol-5D), QALYpatient based on patient preferences for health outcomes (EuroQol VAS), and Incontinence Severity weighted Life Year (ISLY) based on patient-reported severity and impact of UI (ICIQ-UI SF). Health care resource use, patient and family costs, and productivity costs were assessed. Data were collected by three monthly questionnaires. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Uncertainty was assessed using bootstrap simulation, and the expected value of perfect information was calculated (EVPI). Results: Compared to care-as-usual, nurse specialist involvement costs s 16,742/QALYsocietal gained. Both QALYpatient and ISLY yield slightly more favorable cost-effectiveness results. At a threshold of s 40,000/QALYsocietal, the probability that the intervention is cost-effective is 58%. The EVPI amounts to s 78 million. Conclusions: Based on these results, we recommend adopting the nurse specialist intervention in primary care, while conducting more research through careful monitoring of the effectiveness and costs of the intervention in routine practice.

Transitions could be obtained from a cohort study, but often such data may not be available. However, under the assumption that transitions remain stable over time, age specific cross-sectional prevalence data could be used instead. Problems that then arise are parameter identifiability and the fact that age dependent cross-sectional data are often noisy or are given in age intervals. In this paper we propose a method to estimate so-called net annual transition probabilities from cross-sectional data, including their uncertainties. Net transitions only describe the net inflow or outflow into a certain risk factor state at a certain age. Our approach consists of two steps: first, smooth the data using multinomial P-splines, second, from these data estimate net transition probabilities. This second step can be formulated as a transportation problem, which is solved using the simplex algorithm from linear programming theory. A sensible specification of the cost matrix is crucial to get meaningful results. Uncertainties are assessed by parametric bootstrapping. We illustrate our method using data on body mass index. We conclude that this method provides a flexible way of estimating net transitions and that the use of net transitions has implications for model dynamics, for example when modeling interventions.

This may be, however, either unattainable physiologically or financially unviable for drug development. The objective of this study is to provide an empirical basis for this discussion by estimating the potential for price decreases to impact on the cost-effectiveness of new therapies in hypertension. Methods: Cost-effectiveness at launch was estimated for all antihypertensive drugs launched between 1998 and 2008 in the United Kingdom using hypothetical degrees of incremental clinical effectiveness within the methodologic framework applied by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were computed and compared with funding thresholds. In addition, the levels of incremental clinical effectiveness required to achieve specific cost-effectiveness thresholds at given prices were estimated. Results: Significant price decreases were observed for existing drugs. This was shown to markedly affect cost-effectiveness of technologies entering the market. The required incremental clinical effectiveness was in many cases greater than physiologically possible so, as a consequence, a number of products might not be available today if current methods of economic appraisal had been applied. Conclusions: We conclude that the definition of cost-effectiveness thresholds is fundamental in promoting efficient innovation. Our findings demonstrate that comparator price attrition has the potential to put pressure in the pharmaceutical research model and presents a challenge to new therapies being accepted for funding.",pharmaceutical research and development,Health Care Sciences & Services

The widespread implementation makes it evident that health information technology has become a complex socio-technical system that is health care. Design and implementation may result in a failure; even health information technology can lead to adverse events instead of mitigating them. This paper seeks to outline the complexity of health information technology as a part of a socio-technical system, describes two failures at different organizational levels, and presents a model of how risks can occur. This research extends our knowledge on health information technology failure and potential adverse effects, which contributes to the many anecdotal accounts. The IT industry market is highly unregulated and recent reports propose some form of regulation. This paper proposes how, as a first step, proper and mandatory reporting can lead to better knowledge of failures of health information technology as part of a socio-technical system and improve deployment in the coming years.

Empirical evidence from the market for angioplasty in the Netherlands,"A necessary condition for competition to promote quality in hospital markets is that patients are sensitive to differences in hospital quality. In this paper we examine the relationship between hospital quality, as measured by publicly available quality ratings, and patient hospital choice for angioplasty using individual claims data from a large health insurer. We find that Dutch patients have a high propensity to choose hospitals with a good reputation, both overall and for cardiology, and a low readmission rate after treatment for heart failure. Relative to a mean readmission rate of 8.5% we find that a 1%-point lower readmission rate is associated with a 12% increase in hospital demand. Since readmission rates are not adjusted for case-mix they may not provide a correct signal of hospital quality. Insofar patients base their hospital choice on such imperfect quality information, this may result in suboptimal choices and risk selection by hospitals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Separability and the Effect of Framing,"Background. Unweighted summation or quality-adjusted life year (QALY) utilitarianism is the most common way to aggregate health benefits in a cost-effectiveness analysis. A key qualitative principle underlying QALY utilitarianism is separability: those individuals unaffected by a policy choice should not influence the policy choice. Separability also underlies several of the alternatives for QALY utilitarianism that have been proposed. Objectives. To test separability and to test whether the support for separability is affected by the framing of the choice questions. Methods. In 2 experiments, 345 student subjects (162 in the first experiment, and 183 in the second experiment) were asked to select 1 of 2 possible treatments, with each treatment resulting in a different distribution of health across individuals. The only aspect that varied across choice questions was the state of the patients whose health was unaffected by the act of choosing a policy. In each experiment, we used 2 frames. In the implicit frame, it was implied but not plainly expressed what outcomes the treatments had in common. In the explicit frame, common outcomes of the 2 treatments were directly stated. The 2 experiments differed in the way the explicit frame was presented (verbal v. numerical). Results. The support for separability was significantly greater in the explicit frame. The proportion of violations in the implicit frame was 44% in Experiment 1 and 31% in Experiment 2, while in the explicit frame, the proportion of violations was 28% in Experiment 1 and 8% in Experiment 2. Conclusions. Framing affected the support for separability, raising issues as to whether it is possible to achieve a canonical representation of social choices.",equity in distribution/allocation,Medical Informatics

This paper explores what constitutes an intervention that works from the perspective of health promotion professionals (HPP), and how, according to them, the development and implementation of interventions should be improved. We interviewed 81 HPPs about the use of 10 health promotion interventions at 30 Municipality Health Services in The Netherlands. The HPPs described an intervention that works as something that produces its intended effects after being realized in a local situation. Interventions are realized by combining elements of a supplied intervention (e.g. a theory, artefacts) with elements that are situated in the local context (e.g. funding, local network). Interventions that are transferred contain implicit assumptions about local contexts, but it is often unclear what precisely constitutes an intervention and what is assumed of local contexts. An intervention that works is a situated configuration of aligned elements. A linear EB approach depends on the realization of the local circumstances in which 'evidence based' interventions can work. Various strategies are possible for approximating such circumstances, but the core assumption that the configuration that is realized in practice is similar to the 'evidence based' intervention seems unrealistic for most health promotion in the Netherlands. Under such circumstances, attention should shift from central quality assurance to the system of actors and the distributed actions and heterogeneous learning processes that together add up to interventions that work.

The LHMs as well as the policy memoranda can be considered as socially constructed. Preliminary interaction helped to manage the expectations of the local health officials and improved a specific type of use of LHMs in the policy process. However, we discovered a lack of use of the LHMs by specific groups of actors within the policy network, which could be explained by factors influencing the actors, such as personal belief systems and values, institutional interests, and contextual factors such as the design of the policy processes. We concluded that the necessity of interactions depends on the frames of references of the potential users and as a consequence it is difficult to give a single solution for improvement of epidemiological research utilization for local health policy. Different interaction mechanisms between researchers and policy actors can be active at the same time and may differ between municipalities. Therefore it becomes important to obtain insight in the policy process and tailor strategically promising ways of interaction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Both types of insurance are founded on different principles. Since basic and supplementary insurance are sold by the same health insurers, both markets may interact. This paper examines to what extent basic and supplementary insurance are linked to each other and whether these links generate spillover effects of supplementary on basic insurance. Our analysis is based on an investigation into supplementary health insurance contracts, underwriting procedures and annual surveys among 1,700-2,100 respondents over the period 2006-2009. We find that health insurers increasingly use a variety of strategies to enforce a joint purchase of basic and supplementary health insurance. Despite incentives for health insurers to use supplementary insurance as a tool for risk selection in basic insurance, we find limited evidence of supplementary insurance being used this way. Only a minority of health insurers uses health questionnaires when people apply for supplementary coverage. Nevertheless, we find that an increasing proportion of high-risk individuals believe that insurers would not be willing to offer them another supplementary insurance contract. We discuss several strategies to prevent or to counteract the observed negative spillover effects of supplementary insurance.",Guaranteed renewability,Health Care Sciences & Services

Measures taken to control the influx of immigrants include policies that restrict access to publicly funded health care for undocumented migrants. These restrictions to health care access are controversial, and evidence suggests they do not always have the intended effect. This study provides a comparative analysis of institutional, actor-related, and contextual factors that have influenced health care policy development on undocumented migrants in England and the Netherlands. For undocumented migrants, England restricts its access to care at the point of service, while the Netherlands restricts through the payment system for services. The study includes an analysis of policy papers and semistructured, in-depth interviews with various actors in both countries. Findings confirm the influence of such contextual factors as immigration considerations and cost concerns on health care policy making in this area. However, these factors cannot explain the differences between the two countries.

We used a dynamic population model to calculate the cost-effectiveness of ICH El 4 for a prototype QT-prolonging antipsychotic drug entering the US and European markets. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of regulation vs. no regulation were similar to is an element of 2.4 million per sudden cardiac death prevented and 187,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in users of antipsychotic drugs. The main driver of cost was the requirement for electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring of users of QTc-prolonging drugs. Even when several of the assumptions in the model were varied, there were no results in favor of regulation.

Health insurers now pay a single fee to a contracting entity, the care group, to cover all of the primary care needed by patients with these chronic conditions. The initial evaluation of the program indicated that it improved the organization and coordination of care and led to better collaboration among health care providers and better adherence to care protocols. Negative consequences included dominance of the care group by general practitioners, large price variations among care groups that were only partially explained by differences in the amount of care provided, and an administrative burden caused by outdated information and communication technology systems. It is too early to draw conclusions about the effects of the new payment system on the quality or the overall costs of care. However, the introduction of bundled payments might turn out to be a useful step in the direction of risk-adjusted integrated capitation payments for multidisciplinary provider groups offering primary and specialty care to a defined group of patients.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

The second objective was to investigate the hypothesis that diabetes mortality is higher in migrant groups for whom the country of residence (COR) is more affluent than the country of birth (COB). We obtained mortality data from 7 European countries. To assess migrant diabetes mortality, we used direct standardization and Poisson regression. First, migrant mortality was estimated for each country separately. Then, we merged the data from all mortality registers. Subsequently, to examine the second hypothesis, we introduced gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of COB in the models, as an indicator of socio-economic circumstances. The overall pattern shows higher diabetes mortality in migrant populations compared to local-born populations. Mortality rate ratios (MRRs) were highest in migrants originating from either the Caribbean or South Asia. MRRs for the migrant population as a whole were 1.9 (95% CI 1.8-2.0) and 2.2 (95% CI 2.1-2.3) for men and women respectively. We furthermore found a consistently inverse association between GDP of COB and diabetes mortality. Most migrant groups have higher diabetes mortality rates than the local-born populations. Mortality rates are particularly high in migrants from North Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia or low-GDP countries. The inverse association between GDP of COB and diabetes mortality suggests that socio-economic change may be one of the key aetiological factors.",Inequalities,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

The paper examines whether there has been convergence in choice policies across Northern Europe. Following Christopher Pollitt's suggestion, the paper distinguishes between rhetorical (discursive) convergence, decision (design) convergence and implementation (operational) convergence (Pollitt, 2002). This leads to the following research question for the article: Is the introduction of policies to strengthen choice in the four countries characterised by discursive, decision and operational convergence? The paper concludes that there seems to be convergence among these four countries in the overall policy rhetoric about the objectives associated with patient choice, embracing both concepts of empowerment (the intrinsic value) and market competition (the instrumental value). It appears that the institutional context and policy concerns such as waiting times have been important in affecting the timing of the introduction of choice policies and implementation, but less so in the design of choice policies. An analysis of the impact of choice policies is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is concluded that further research should investigate how the institutional context and timing of implementation affect differences in how the choice policy works out in practice.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

Methods: In a cross-sectional study in 80 parents of 57 adult, severely disabled DMD patients' level of subjective caregiver burden was measured with the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) and the Self Rated Burden Scale. A visual analogue scale was used to measure happiness. The expanded CSI version, the CarerQoL and open questions were used to analyse caregiving in more depth. In uni and multivariate analyses, associations of objective care characteristics, patient characteristics and caregiver characteristics with burden were explored. Results: Parents indicated substantial burden, but valued giving care as being important and rewarding. Subjective burden was associated with received support, tracheotomy, active coping by the patient and anxiety in patient and parents, together explaining 34%-36% of variance. Living situation was not associated with experienced burden. Conclusions: Caring for an adult son with DMD is burdensome, but rewarding. Subjective caregiver burden of parents may be alleviated by adequate support and respite care, by avoiding tracheotomy and by intervention programs targeting anxiety and promoting active coping by the patient from childhood.",tracheotomy,Rehabilitation

Methods: The EVIC quantifies how much benefits are forgone when a treatment decision is based on the best-expected outcomes in the population rather than in the individual patient. We have reviewed which types of patient-level attributes contribute to the EVIC and how they affect the interpretation of the outcomes. In addition, we have applied the EVIC framework to the outcomes of a microsimulation-based cost-effectiveness analysis for glaucoma treatment. Results: For EVIC outcomes to inform decisions about clinical practice, we need to calculate the parameter-specific EVIC of known or knowable patient-level attributes and compare it with the real costs of implementing individualized care. In the case study, the total EVIC was (sic)580 per patient, but patient-level attributes known at treatment decision had minimal impact. A subgroup policy based on individual disease progression could be worthwhile if a predictive test for glaucoma progression could be developed and implemented for less than (sic)130 per patient. Conclusions: The EVIC framework is feasible in cost-effectiveness analyses and can be informative for decision making. The EVIC outcomes are particularly informative when they are (close to) zero. When the EVIC has a high value, implications depend on the type of patient-level attribute. EVIC can be a useful tool to identify opportunities to improve efficiency in health care by individualization of care and to quantify the maximal investment opportunities for implementing subgroup policy.",value of information,Health Care Sciences & Services

We analyzed how the different actors involved in the collaborative were governed and came to govern themselves differently. Measurement instruments were an example of a dominant mechanism by which actors at different levels of the collaborative were governed: by accounting for improvements, introducing or strengthening a certain way of thinking about health care clients, and changing how clients thought about and acted upon themselves.

We use a large representative sample of Dutch citizens and include two health states generally considered better than dead (BTD) and one health state considered worse than dead (WTD). Independence cannot be rejected when comparing the BID health states, but is rejected when comparing the BTD states with the WTD state. In particular, utility of life duration becomes more concave for the WTD state. This may suggest that independence holds only for BID health states. This has implications for the QALY model and would require using sign-dependent utility of life duration functions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this article is to develop a questionnaire that captures the time lost from work due to a health problem and job and workplace characteristics so that the value of productivity loss to society can be calculated. Methods: First, a questionnaire battery was developed by selecting items from existing productivity questionnaires. Next, items with similar content were identified and duplications were eliminated. Third, the draft questionnaire's feasibility was pretested in a focus group (n = 15). Finally, after appropriate refinements, its applicability was tested in 140 employed patients with rheumatoid arthritis recruited from a cohort in the United Kingdom. Multipliers relating the wage to marginal productivity were also derived using the questionnaire. Results: The final questionnaire includes items on employment status; absenteeism; presenteeism; unpaid work; and job characteristics, which includes questions on team dynamics, availability of substitutes and their substitutability, time sensitivity, and compensation mechanisms. The importance of incorporating these questions demonstrated that when one employee was absent, or present at work but unable to work at full capacity, the consequent output loss could exceed the output of the employee alone. Multipliers were shown to be greater than one and represented the excess output loss. Conclusions: The new questionnaire enabled the job and workplace characteristics to be captured so that the actual productivity loss at the societal level attributable to absenteeism and presenteeism could be valued.",wage multiplier,Health Care Sciences & Services

In this paper four case studies are presented on the use of the SWOT-analysis in different parts of the health care sector in the Netherlands.

Information from these publications was abstracted regarding outcome, quality, and modeling methods. Results: We identified 20 economic evaluations comprising 5 different endocrine therapeutic strategies, which are all assessed more then once. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the reported outcomes varied widely for identical therapies. For anastrazole compared to tamoxifen, incremental life-years gained even ranged from 0.16 to 0.550 with an ICER ranging from (sic)3,958 to (sic)75,331. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained ranged from 0.092 to 0.378 with a cost per QALY gained varying from (sic)3,696 to (sic)120,265. These large differences in outcome were related to different modeling methods, with differences in time horizon and use of a carryover effect as most prominent causes. Conclusion: Despite similar comparators and logical differences due to transferability issues, the outcomes of the included studies varied widely. To increase comparability and transparency of pharmacoeconomic evaluations, standardization of modeling methods for different therapeutic groups/diseases and the availability of a detailed and complete description of the model used in the evaluation is advocated. Recommendations for standardization in modeling treatment strategies in early breast cancer are presented.",Markov,Health Care Sciences & Services

Little is known about how well guidelines about adjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer are followed in daily practice. We evaluated the current guideline, which is based on the MOSAIC trial, by examining implementation, treatment patterns and disease-free survival. Material and methods. We analysed a population-based cohort of 391 patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer in 2005-2006. Data were gathered from the Dutch Cancer Registry and medical records of 19 hospitals. Patients were classified according to whether or not they fulfilled MOSAIC trial eligibility criteria. Results. The administered regimens were: fluorouracil-leucovorin (17 patients), capecitabine (93), fluorouracil-leucovorin plus oxaliplatin (145), and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (136). After its inclusion in national guidelines, oxaliplatin was prescribed in 16 hospitals within six months. Patients receiving oxaliplatin were younger and had less comorbidity than other patients. Dose schedules corresponded well with guidelines. Two-year disease-free survival probability of oxaliplatin patients meeting MOSAIC eligibility criteria was 78.4% (95% CI 72.5-84.3), which was comparable to MOSAIC trial results. Conclusion. Guidelines for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer are generally well followed in daily practice. However, uncertainty remains regarding the optimal treatment of elderly patients and patients with comorbidities, which underscores the need for practical clinical trials including these patients.",,Oncology

Qualitative interviews with 27 surgeons and 28 general practitioners in The Netherlands, held 2-3 years after a major overhaul of the Dutch health care system involving several market reforms. Surgeons now regularly advertise their work (while this was forbidden in the past) and pay more attention to patients with relatively minor afflictions, thus deviating from codes of ethics that oblige physicians to treat each other as brothers and to treat patients according to medical need. Dutch GPs have abandoned their traditional reticence and their fear of medicalization. They now seem to treat more in accordance with patients' preferences and less in accordance with medical need. Market reforms do affect medical professional principles, and it is doubtful whether these changes were intended when Dutch policy makers decided to introduce market elements in the health care system. Policy makers in other countries considering similar reforms should pay attention to these results.",General practitioners,Biomedical Social Sciences

Survival for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has reached 80-90%. Future improvement in treatment success will involve new technologies and medication, adding to the pressure on limited financial resources. Therefore a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis of ALL treatment with chemotherapy only according to the two most recent Dutch Childhood Oncology Group treatment protocols was performed. The most recent protocol ALL 10 included more expensive medication (pegasparaginase) and implemented a new diagnostic technique (minimal residual disease levels) compared to the previous ALL9 protocol. Procedure. Fifty children from a single center cohort were included. All direct medical costs made during treatment, including those in satellite hospitals, were determined. Costs per life year saved (LYS) were calculated. The cost-effectiveness ratio of the most recent treatment protocol was determined. LYS were calculated based on national 5-year event-free survival. Results. Mean total costs were between $ 115,858 (ALL9) and $ 163,350 (ALL10) per patient. Hospital admissions (57%) and medication (11-17%) were important drivers of overall costs, and were higher in the most recent protocol ALL10. Costs per LYS were $ 1,962 (ALL9) and $ 2,655 (ALL10) and the cost-effectiveness ratio was $ 8,215. Conclusion. Treatment of childhood ALL with chemotherapy only is well within accepted ranges of cost-effectiveness. The use of new technology and more expensive medication in the most recent protocol ALL10 lead to higher costs but more LYS. In future (ALL) treatment protocols, costs in relation to effects should be taken into account in order to establish more cost-effective disease management without jeopardizing survival and quality of life.

Methods: The model is a multistate Markov model with time varying transition rates specified by age, sex, smoking status, COPD disease severity, and/or exacerbation type. The model simulates annual changes in COPD prevalence due to COPD incidence, exacerbations, disease progression (annual decline in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second as percentage of the predicted value), and mortality. The main outcome variables are quality-adjusted life years, total exacerbations, and COPD-related health care costs. Exacerbation-related input parameters were based on quantitative meta-analysis. All important model parameters are entered into the model as probability distributions. To illustrate the potential use of the model, costs and effects were calculated for 3-year implementation of three different COPD interventions, one pharmacologic, one on smoking cessation, and one on pulmonary rehabilitation using a time horizon of 10 years for reporting outcomes. Results: Compared with minimal treatment the cost/quality-adjusted life year was (sic)17,300 for the pharmacologic intervention, (sic)10,800 for the smoking cessation therapy, (sic)8,700 for the combination of the pharmacologic intervention and the smoking cessation therapy, and (sic)17,200 for the pulmonary rehabilitation program. The probability of the interventions to be cost-effective at a ceiling ratio of (sic)20,000 varied from 58% to 100%.

The Netherlands is one of the countries where this trend has gone furthest. In the literature some problems are identified, such as instrumental use of patient organizations by care providers, health insurers and the pharmaceutical industry. To strengthen the position of patient organizations government funding is often recommended as a solution. In this paper we analyze the ties between Dutch government and Dutch patient organizations to learn more about the effects of such a relationship between government and this part of civil society. Our study is based on official government documents and existing empirical research on patient organizations. We found that government influence on patient organizations has become quite substantial with government influencing the organizational structure of patient organizations, the activities these organizations perform and even their ideology. Financing patient organizations offers the government an important means to hold them accountable. Although the ties between patient organizations and the government enable the former to play a role that can be valued as positive by both parties, we argue that they raise problems as well which warrant a discussion on how much government influence on civil society is acceptable.",Patient organizations,Biomedical Social Sciences

The aggregation of attributes in the absence of risk is studied in conjoint measurement. In conjoint measurement, standard sequences have been widely used to empirically measure and test utility functions, and to theoretically analyze them. This paper shows that utility independence and standard sequences are closely related: utility independence is equivalent to a standard sequence invariance condition when applied to risk. This simple relation between two widely used conditions in adjacent fields of research is surprising and useful. It facilitates the testing of utility independence because standard sequences are flexible and can avoid cancelation biases that affect direct tests of utility independence.

This approach cyclically executes a master surgical schedule of surgery types. Surgery types need to be constructed with low variability to be efficient. Each surgery type is scheduled based upon its frequency per cycle. Surgery types that cannot be scheduled repetitively are put together in so-called dummy surgeries. Narrowly defined surgery types, with low variability, lead to many of such dummy surgeries, which reduces the benefits of a master surgical scheduling approach. In this paper we propose a method, based on Ward's hierarchical cluster method, to obtain surgery types that minimize the weighted sum of the dummy surgery volume and the variability in resource demand of surgery types. The resulting surgery types (clusters) are thus based on logical features and can be used in master surgical scheduling.

The role of the threshold value for a QALY has been given little consideration in these checklists, even though the importance of a factor as a cause of between country differences in CE depends on this threshold. In this paper, we study the impact of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) per QALY on the importance of transferability factors in the case of smoking cessation support (SCS). We investigated, for several values of the WTP, how differences between six countries affect the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of SCS. The investigated factors were demography, smoking prevalence, mortality, epidemiology and costs of smoking-related diseases, resource use and unit costs of SCS, utility weights and discount rates. We found that when the WTP decreased, factors that mainly affect health outcomes became less important and factors that mainly effect costs became more important. With a WTP below a,not sign1,000, the factors most responsible for between country differences in INMB were resource use and unit costs of SCS and the costs of smoking-related diseases. Utility values had little impact. At a threshold above a,not sign10,000, between country differences were primarily due to different discount rates, utility weights and epidemiology of smoking-related diseases. Costs of smoking-related diseases had little impact. At all thresholds, demography had little impact. We concluded that, when judging the transferability of a CE study, we should consider the between country differences in WTP threshold values.",QALY,Health Care Sciences & Services

Psychological factors that were analysed were agoraphobia, depression, somatization, insufficiency, (interpersonal) sensitivity, insomnia, and life events. In total, 596 consecutive patients were included in the study, and 7.0% were diagnosed with CRPS1. None of the psychological factors predicted the development of CRPS1. The scores on the Symptom Checklist-90 subscales fell into the range of the general population and were, in most cases, average or below average when compared with those of pain patients or psychiatric patients. No empirical evidence supports a diagnosis of CRPS1 patients as psychologically different, and the current results indicate that there is no association between psychological factors and CRPS1.

A Pilot Study","Introduction Most workers with musculoskeletal disorders on sick leave often consult with regular health care before entering a specific work rehabilitation program. However, it remains unclear to what extent regular healthcare contributes to the timely return to work (RTW). Moreover, several studies have indicated that it might postpone RTW. There is a need to establish the influence of regular healthcare on RTW as outcome; ""Does visiting a regular healthcare provider influence the duration of sickness absence and recurrent sick leave due to musculoskeletal disorders?''. Methods A cohort of workers on sick leave for 2-6 weeks due to a-specific musculoskeletal disorders was followed for 12 months. The main outcomes for the present analysis were: duration of sickness absence till 100% return to work and recurrent sick leave after initial RTW. Cox regression analyses were conducted with visiting a general health practitioner, physical therapist, or medical specialist during the sick leave period as independent variables. Each regression model was adjusted for variables known to influence health care utilization like age, sex, diagnostic group, pain intensity, functional disability, general health perception, severity of complaints, job control, and physical load at work. Results Patients visiting a medical specialist reported higher pain intensity and more functional limitations and also had a worse health perception at start of the sick leave period compared with those not visiting a specialist. Visiting a medical specialist delayed return to work significantly (HR = 2.10; 95%CI 1.43-3.07). After approximately 8 weeks on sick leave workers visiting a physical therapist returned to work faster than other workers. A recurrent episode of sick leave during the follow up quick was initiated by higher pain intensity and more functional limitations at the moment of fully return to work. Visiting a primary healthcare provider during the sickness absence period did not influence the occurrence of a new sick leave period. Conclusion Despite the adjustment for severity of the musculoskeletal disorder, visiting a medical specialist was associated with a delayed full return to work. More attention to the factor 'labor' in the regular healthcare is warranted, especially for those patients experiencing substantial functional limitations due to musculoskeletal disorders.",Musculoskeletal disorders,Social Issues

Four types of resources are considered: operating theatre, beds in the medium and in the intensive care units, and nursing hours in the intensive care unit. A tactical plan is obtained by minimizing the deviations of the resources consumption to the target levels of resources utilization, following a goal programming approach. The MIP formulation to get this tactical plan is specifically designed to account for emergency care since it allows for the reservation of some capacity for emergency patients and possible capacity excess. To deal with the deviation between actually arriving elective patients and the average number of patients on which the tactical plan is based, we consider the possibility of planning a higher number of patients than the average to create operating slots in the tactical plan (slack planning). These operating slots are then filled in the operational plan following several flexibility rules. We consider three options for slack planning that lead to three different tactical plans on which we apply three flexibility rules to get finally nine alternative weekly schedules of elective patients. We then develop an algorithm to modify this schedule on a daily basis so as to account for emergency patients' arrivals. Scheduled elective patients may be cancelled and emergency patients may be sent to other hospitals. Cancellation rules for both types of patients rely on the possibility to exceed the available capacities. Several performance indicators are defined to assess patient service and hospital efficiency. Simulation results show a trade-off between hospital efficiency and patient service. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Goal programming,Operations Research & Management Science

The Generation R Study","Despite compulsory health insurance in Europe, ethnic differences in access to health care exist. The objective of this study is to investigate how ethnic differences between Dutch and non-Dutch women with respect to late entry into antenatal care provided by community midwifes can be explained by need, predisposing and enabling factors. Data were obtained from the Generation R Study. The Generation R Study is a multi-ethnic population-based prospective cohort study conducted in the city of Rotterdam. In total, 2,093 pregnant women with a Dutch, Moroccan, Turkish, Cape Verdean, Antillean, Surinamese Creole and Surinamese Hindustani background were included in this study. We examined whether ethnic differences in late antenatal care entry could be explained by need, predisposing and enabling factors. Subsequently, logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent role of explanatory variables in the timing of antenatal care entry. The main outcome measure was late entry into antenatal care (gestational age at first visit after 14 weeks). With the exception of Surinamese-Hindustani women, the percentage of mothers entering antenatal care late was higher in all non-Dutch compared to Dutch mothers. We could explain differences between Turkish (OR = 0.95, CI: 0.57-1.58), Cape Verdean (OR = 1.65. CI: 0.96-2.82) and Dutch women. Other differences diminished but remained significant (Moroccan: OR = 1,74, CI: 1.07-2.85; Dutch Antillean OR 1.80, CI: 1.04-3.13). We found that non-Dutch mothers were more likely to enter antenatal care later than Dutch mothers. Because we are unable to explain fully the differences regarding Moroccan, Surinamese-Creole and Antillean women, future research should focus on differences between 1st and 2nd generation migrants, as well as on language barriers that may hinder access to adequate information about the Dutch obstetric system.",Late entry,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

In this study, we considered a broader picture assessing improved quality of life compared with costs. A model served as a tool to compare costs and effects of treatment according to a new protocol and care as usual. Quality of life was measured and valued by proxies using a general quality-of-life instrument (EQ-5D). We considered medical cost and non-medical cost (e.g. remedial teaching). The model computed cost per successful treatment and cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) in time. About 75% of the total costs was related to diagnostic tests to distinguish between children with severe dyslexia and children who have reading difficulties for other reasons. The costs per successful treatment of severe dyslexia were (sic)36 366. Successful treatment showed a quality-of-life gain of about 11%. At primary school, the average cost per QALY for severe dyslexia amounted to (sic)58 647. In the long term, the cost per QALY decreased to (sic)26 386 at secondary school and (sic)17 663 thereafter.

The results of a few small non-randomized studies suggest that, in selected patients with proven PE, outpatient treatment is potentially feasible and safe. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of outpatient treatment according to predefined criteria in patients with acute PE. Patients and Methods: A prospective cohort study of patients with objectively proven acute PE was conducted in 12 hospitals in The Netherlands between 2008 and 2010. Patients with acute PE were triaged with the predefined criteria for eligibility for outpatient treatment, with LMWH (nadroparin) followed by vitamin K antagonists. All patients eligible for outpatient treatment were sent home either immediately or within 24 h after PE was objectively diagnosed. Outpatient treatment was evaluated with respect to recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), including PE or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), major hemorrhage and total mortality during 3 months of follow-up. Results: Of 297 included patients, who all completed the follow-up, six (2.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-4.3) had recurrent VTE (five PE [1.7%] and one DVT [0.3%]). Three patients (1.0%, 95% CI 0.2-2.9) died during the 3 months of follow-up, none of fatal PE. Two patients had a major bleeding event, one of which was fatal intracranial bleeding (0.7%, 95% CI 0.08-2.4). Conclusion: Patients with PE selected for outpatient treatment with predefined criteria can be treated with anticoagulants on an outpatient basis.

For this, women with a first breast cancer hospitalisation during 2000-2007 were selected from the PHARMO Record Linkage System, including drug use and hospitalisations of three million inhabitants in the Netherlands, and matched 1:10 by age to cancer-free women. The occurrence of MI, IS and PE were assessed in the 12 months before and after breast cancer hospitalisation. The study included 11,473 breast cancer patients, with a mean (+/- SD) age of 59 (+/- 14) years. Breast cancer patients were two to three times as likely as their cancer-free controls to have had a hospitalisation for PE, MI or IS in the 12 months before diagnosis, though prevalence was <1% in all groups. Breast cancer patients experienced an extreme high risk of PE in the first six months after diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 23.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.1-49.7 compared to controls), which declined gradually to a four times increased risk (HR 3.6, 95%CI 2.4-5.5) more than 12 months after breast cancer hospitalisation. However, incidence was low: less than five events per 1,000 person years during all time periods. For MI and IS we did not observe significant increased HRs after breast cancer hospitalisation compared to controls.

The quality of economic evaluations should be taken into account by clinicians involved in decision-making. A systematic review and critique of the methodology was performed to assess the trends and quality in economic evaluations in multiple myeloma to date. A literature search was conducted to identify full economic evaluations in multiple myeloma as of December 2009. Details of the economic evaluation methods applied were extracted. Each study underwent a quality assessment based on the Drummond checklist for appraisal of high-quality economic evaluations in health care. Eighteen published economic evaluations were identified. Stem cell transplantation in combination with intensive chemotherapy has been demonstrated to be cost-effective, while interferon alpha is generally ineffective at additional costs. Evaluations have become less frequent in the last decade, especially for newer therapies despite their important contribution to improvements in outcomes. The quality of the methodology applied and its documentation can be improved in many aspects. As users of the results of economic evaluations, clinicians involved in guiding decision-making should be critical of the quality of economic evaluations in multiple myeloma. To ensure access to and identification of high-quality studies, researchers conducting economic evaluations of future advances should strive towards evaluations that fulfil the Drummond criteria and are properly documented.

Drugs in four groups were considered: cholesterol-lowering agents, insulin analogues, biologic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and ""atypical"" drugs for schizophrenia. Compared with HTA, reference pricing is a relatively blunt instrument for obtaining value for money from pharmaceuticals. Thus, its role in making reimbursement decisions should be limited to drugs which are therapeutically equivalent. HTA is a superior strategy for obtaining value for money because it addresses not only price but also the appropriate indications for the use of the drug and the relation between additional value and additional costs. However, given the relatively higher costs of conducting HTAs, the most efficient approach might be a combination of both policies.",Health policy,Health Care Sciences & Services

By-person factor analysis revealed four distinct preference segments for middle-distance travel: (1) choice travellers with a preference for public transport, (2) deliberate-choice travellers, (3) choice travellers with car as dominant alternative, and (4) car-dependent travellers. These preference segments differ in terms of the levels of involvement and cognitive effort in travel decision making, the travel consideration-set and underlying motivations. The study showed that for most people there is more to travel than getting from point A to point B, and that there is considerable heterogeneity in middle-distance travel preferences. Policy implications for reducing the need for travel and promoting a modal shift from car to other travel modes are discussed.",Segmentation,Transportation

This is known as the 'red herring' hypothesis. In this article, we investigate whether this is also the case regarding disease-specific hospital expenditures. Longitudinal data samples from the Dutch hospital register (n = 11 253 455) were used to estimate 94 disease-specific two-part models. Based on these models, Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess the predictive value of proximity to death and age on disease-specific expenditures. Results revealed that there was a clear effect of proximity of death on health care expenditures. This effect was present for most diseases and was strongest for most cancers. However, even for some less fatal diseases, proximity to death was found to be an important predictor of expenditures. Controlling for proximity to death, age was found to be a significant predictor of expenditures for most diseases. However, its impact is modest when compared to proximity to death. Considering the large variation in the degree to which proximity to death and age matter for each specific disease, we may speak not only of age as a 'red herring' but also of a 'carpaccio of red herrings'.

Arguments in favour of the inclusion of such costs are gaining support, which shifts the question from whether to how to include these costs. This paper elaborates on the issue how to include cost in life years gained in cost effectiveness analysis given the current practice of economic evaluations in which costs of related diseases are included. We combine insights from the theoretical literature on the inclusion of unrelated medical costs in life years gained with insights from the so-called 'red herring' literature. It is argued that for most interventions it would be incorrect to simply add all medical costs in life years gained to an ICER, even when these are corrected for postponement of the expensive last year of life. This is the case since some of the postponement mechanism is already captured in the unadjusted ICER by modelling the costs of related diseases. Using the example of smoking cessation, we illustrate the differences and similarities between different approaches. The paper concludes with a discussion about the proper way to account for medical costs in life years gained in economic evaluations.

Specifically, we examine whether insurers have been able to take up their role as prudent buyers of care and examine consumers' attitudes towards insurers' new role. Health insurers' contracting behaviour is investigated by an extensive analysis of available information on purchasing practices by health insurers and by interviews with directors of health care purchasing of the four major health insurers, accounting for 90% of the market. Consumer attitudes towards insurers' new role are investigated by surveys among a representative sample of enrollees over the period 2005-2009. During the first four years of the reform, health insurers were very reluctant to engage in selective contracting and preferred to use 'soft' positive incentives to encourage preferred provider choice rather than engaging in restrictive managed care activities. Consumer attitudes towards channelling vary considerably by type of provider but generally became more negative in the first two years after the reform. Insurers' reluctance to use selective contracting can be at least partly explained by the presence of a credible-commitment problem. Consumers do not trust that insurers with restrictive networks are committed to provide good quality care. The credible-commitment problem seems to be particularly relevant to the Netherlands, since Dutch enrollees are not used to restrictions on provider choice. Since consumers are quite sensitive to differences in provider quality, more reliable information about provider quality is required to reduce the credible-commitment problem.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

Changes in the health of patients may affect the health of so-called ""significant others"" in 2 distinct ways. First, an individual may provide informal care to the patient and be burdened by the process of care giving. We label this indirect effect of a patient's health on the health of the care giver the ""care-giving effect."" Second, a person may suffer from health losses because someone in his or her social environment is ill, regardless of his or her care-giving status. The health of the patient then directly affects the health of this significant other, which we label the ""family effect."" Methods. We investigate the occurrence of the family and care-giving effect in a convenience sample of Dutch care givers (n = 751). The family effect was approximated by the health status of the patient (measured on EuroQol-VAS), and the care-giving effect by the number of the care-giving tasks was provided. It was assumed that care givers' health is positively associated with patients' health, that is, the family effect, and negatively associated with care-giving burden, that is, the care-giving effect. Relationships are studied using multivariate regressions. Results. Our results support the existence of both types of health effects. The analysis shows that the 2 effects are separable and independently associated with the health of care givers. Not accounting for the family effect conflates the care-giving effect. Conclusions. If the goal of health care policy is to optimize health, all important effects should be captured. The scope of economic evaluations should also include health effects in significant others. This study suggests that significant others include both care givers and broader groups of affected individuals, such as family members.",economic evaluation,Medical Informatics

Considerable within-country differences have been reported too, with decreased perinatal health in deprived urban areas. We investigated associations between perinatal risk factors and adverse perinatal outcomes in 7,359 pregnant women participating in population-based prospective cohort study, to establish the independent role, if any, for living within a deprived urban neighbourhood. Main outcome measures included perinatal death, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, congenital malformations, Apgar at 5 min <7, and pre-eclampsia. Information regarding individual risk factors was obtained from questionnaires, physical examinations, ultrasounds, biological samples, and medical records. The dichotomous Dutch deprivation indicator was additionally used to test for unexplained deprived urban area effects. Pregnancies from a deprived neighbourhood had an increased risk for perinatal death (RR 1.8, 95% CI [1.1; 3.1]). IUGR, prematurity, Apgar at 5 min <7, and pre-eclampsia also showed higher prevalences (P < 0.05). Residing within a deprived neighbourhood was associated with increased prevalence of all measured risk factors. Regression analysis showed that the observed neighbourhood related differences in perinatal outcomes could be attributed to the increased risk factor prevalence only, without a separated role for living within a deprived neighbourhood. Women from a deprived neighbourhood had significantly more 'possibly avoidable' risk factors. To conclude, women from a socioeconomically deprived neighbourhood are at an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Differences regarding possibly avoidable risk factors imply that preventive strategies may prove effective.",Risk factors,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

In the Netherlands, by contrast, such discussions have remained relatively narrow and led to only minor changes in framing food safety as a policy issue. This relative stability of Dutch food safety policy rests on particular understandings of food safety and can best be explored by means of a policy discourse analysis. Such a perspective combines a poststructuralist conceptualisation of discourse with an interpretive approach to policy analysis, whereby discourses constitute the policy process. Adopting such an analytical perspective, this study suggests that in the Dutch case, three contextually specific discourses functioned to delimit meanings around food safety: (1) a technocratic discourse of governance; (2) a discourse of market efficiency, which links the meaning of food safety primarily to its economic implications; and (3) a specific consumer discourse, which constructs consumption (for instance, in favour of sustainability) as a matter of individual choice and private responsibility. These discourses have demarcated the meaning of 'food safety' in contemporary policy discourse in the Netherlands. Food safety became articulated as a technically defined, self-evident concept that does not require fundamental debate and food safety policy remained comparatively stable. Alternative policy options that articulate food safety as a wider political concept stretching from agricultural production to consumption, thus 'politics from stable to table', have thus far remained marginal, as this discourse analysis reveals.",Netherlands,History & Philosophy of Science

Boundary configurations are strongly situated interconnections between science advisory institutes and policy institutions that share a specific approach to problem definitions and methods and that are embedded in (and at the same time embed) specific social, discursive, and material elements. Importantly, as the case study shows, such boundary configurations shape the kind of science, and related, the kind of social and political theories about the world, that is effectuated in modeling practices.

Although supply and price regulation still dominates the allocation of health services, purchaser competition has already significantly affected the provision of hospital care, pharmaceuticals and primary care, as well as efforts to gather and disseminate information about quality of care. From this perspective, the glass is half full. However, based on the crude performance indicators available, the reforms have not yet demonstrated significant effects on the performance of the Dutch health system.

Growing life expectancy of future generations should raise social discount rates for health because of diminishing marginal utility of additional health gains and equity reasons reflecting the desire for a more equitable distribution of benefits over generations. This influence has, however, been largely ignored in empirical studies. We provide a first comprehensive analysis of how time preferences for health gains vary with projected growth rates, indicating the importance of subjective expectations about the growth in life expectancy in the elicitation of social time preference. Six hundred and fifty-six respondents, representative of the Dutch population, completed one of four questionnaires, differing in the projected growth in life expectancy. Results showed that individuals discount future health gains at different rates, depending on the latency period and on the projected or expected growth in life expectancy. As hypothesized, discount rates increased with higher growth rates. The association between observed discount rates and expectations regarding future life expectancy was confirmed, suggesting that discount rates for health may depend on future life expectancy.

Additionally, the follow-up costs in the first year after initial treatment were assessed. Cost analyses were performed at two neurosurgical departments in The Netherlands from the healthcare providers' perspective. A total of 59 patients were included, of whom 18 underwent microsurgery, 15 underwent LINAC radiosurgery, and 26 underwent gamma knife radiosurgery. A standardized microcosting methodology was employed to ensure that the identified cost differences would reflect only actual cost differences. Initial treatment costs, using equipment costs per fraction, were a,not sign12,288 for microsurgery, a,not sign1,547 for LINAC radiosurgery, and a,not sign2,412 for gamma knife radiosurgery. Higher initial treatment costs for microsurgery were predominantly due to inpatient stay (a,not sign5,321) and indirect costs (a,not sign4,350). LINAC and gamma knife radiosurgery were equally expensive when equipment was valued per treatment (a,not sign2,198 and a,not sign2,412, respectively). Follow-up costs were slightly, but not significantly, higher for microsurgery compared with LINAC and gamma knife radiosurgery. Even though initial treatment costs were over five times higher for microsurgery compared with both radiosurgical treatments, our study gives indications that the relative cost difference may decrease when follow-up costs occurring during the first year after initial treatment are incorporated. This reinforces the need to consider follow-up costs after initial treatment when examining the relative costs of alternative treatments.",Radiosurgery,Neurosciences & Neurology

In this paper, we have analysed the role screening methods and risk profile assessments fulfil as part of prevention and health promotion programmes in the selection, enrolment and participation of participants. Our analysis showed, that screening methods and health risk assessments create effects as they objectify health risks and/or the health status of individuals, i.e., they select the individuals 'at risk' and indicate the lifestyle modifications these people are required to make in order to improve their health. Yet, these instruments also reduce the group of participants thereby decreasing the possible effect of interventions, as they provide the legitimisation for people to make choices to whether they enrol or not and what lifestyle changes they incorporate into their lives. In other words, they present a space of interaction, in which agency is distributed across the practice nurses, the participants and the instruments. Decisions were not just made upon the projection of the outcomes of these instruments; decisions that were made by both the patients and practice nurses were the resultant of their opinions on these outcomes that were formed in interaction with the instruments.",Screening methods,Biomedical Social Sciences

For theoretical purposes, we use TTO sequences to axiomatize (quasi-) hyperbolic discount functions. We demonstrate the feasibility of measuring TTO sequences in an experiment, in which we tested the axiomatizations.

Drawing on an SCM perspective, this study develops our understanding of (1) the intra-firm HR supply chain, and (2) how this HR supply chain influences corporate governance processes within large organizations. We argue that the HR function, represented as an internal professional service supply chain, needs appropriate governance principles as it operates through multiple delivery channels and with a wide variety of HRM practices. Exploratory findings from a qualitative empirical study of seven large organizations investigating governance and risk management in the HR supply chain are presented. These in-depth interviews uncover how formal governance is relatively easy for these organizations to achieve, supported by outcome-focused monitoring tools, but informal governance mechanisms can fail due to insufficient attention. Although standardized approaches to HR delivery can maximize the opportunity for HR governance, little evidence was found that the organizations were considering the related governance implications explicitly.

In this article, I explore the relevance of experimental interventions in health care practices for both these care practices and for issues of the normativity of STS research. By analyzing my involvement in changes in the practice of hemophilia home treatment, I indicate how this care practice was reconfigured, partly by drawing on STS insights on the issue of compliance. I also claim that experimenting with forms of ""artful contamination'' allow STS researchers to do normativity in the practices they engage with. Such practices of interventionist STS research may be of value for refiguring debates in which constructivism has been accused of being normatively deficient.

This objective reduces to one of minimising the number of parts produced when cutting the tray load of buns. We offer a closed form optimization approach to this class of problems for certain cases, without recourse to mathematical programming or heuristics.

Additional medical costs in life years gained due to treatment of unrelated diseases may offset possible savings in related diseases, but are often ignored both in health promotion policies and in economic evaluations of life-prolonging interventions. Many national guidelines explicitly recommend excluding these costs from economic evaluations or leave inclusion up to the discretion of the analyst. This may result in too favorable estimations of cost-effectiveness, feeding the unjustified optimism among policymakers regarding lifestyle interventions as a cost-saving option.

In this study we determined switching rates from tamoxifen to AIs, discontinuation rates of tamoxifen only, discontinuation rates of any endocrine treatment and determinants of first treatment switch and treatment discontinuation. Patients with early stage breast cancer (stage I-IIIa) starting on tamoxifen were selected from the linked Eindhoven Cancer Registry-PHARMO RLS cohort in the period 1998-2006. Continuous use (allowing a 60 days gap between refills) of tamoxifen only and any endocrine treatment were determined after various follow-up periods: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. Time to first switch from tamoxifen to an AI was assessed. Cox regression was used to identify determinants of first treatment switch, discontinuation of tamoxifen, and discontinuation of any endocrine treatment. A total of 1,451 new early stage breast cancer patients started on tamoxifen. Of those, 380 had a treatment switch to an AI during follow-up. Of the patients followed for 5 years, 40% continuously used tamoxifen, which was 49% for any endocrine treatment. Older age (older than 70 versus 50-69 years) was independently associated with increased discontinuation of tamoxifen and any endocrine therapy. Patients with two or more concomitant diseases (versus no comorbidity) showed an increased likelihood to stop any endocrine treatment or switch treatment from tamoxifen to an AI. In conclusion, up to half of the breast cancer patients starting tamoxifen continued 5 years of endocrine treatment. Identification of patients at risk of discontinuation will assist in the development of interventions to improve treatment continuation comparable to that of patients included in clinical trials.",Tamoxifen,Oncology

To clarify the role of weight change as a risk factor for diabetes, the authors assessed the association between weight change and diabetes incidence conditional upon either initial or attained body mass index (BMI). They used 7,837 observations available from repeated measurements of 4,259 participants (men and women aged 20-59 years) in the Dutch population-based Doetinchem Cohort Study (1987-2007) to analyze the association between 5-year weight change and diabetes incidence (n = 124) in the subsequent 5 years. When adjusted for initial BMI, 5-year weight change was a significant risk factor for diabetes (odds ratio = 1.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.13 per kilogram of weight change). However, no significant association was found between weight change and diabetes if the association was adjusted for attained BMI (odds ratio = 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.04 per kilogram of weight change). Results suggest that weight change is associated with diabetes incidence because, conditional upon initial BMI, weight change determines attained BMI. This finding implies that lifestyle interventions can contribute to diabetes prevention because they affect attained BMI.

The average annual societal costs per patient were significantly lower in the intervention group (euro1011 vs euro1.166). Productivity costs were the largest cost component, in particular costs due to reduced efficiency at paid work which were responsible for 47% and 56% of the total costs in the intervention and control group respectively.

For England the analysis draws on national data and published studies on 'Choose and Book', national patient surveys, and qualitative data based on general practitioner (GP) focus groups. For the Netherlands the analysis draws on qualitative data collected during observational study as well as survey data among patients, GPs and medical specialists. We find that despite significant differences in the genesis and design of the policy, similar challenges have been faced. The electronic referral systems have forced changes to the process of care at the interface between primary and secondary care and standardisation between practices. Although these changes have the potential to generate improvements and benefits, for example, convenience, certainty and choice for patients and efficiency gains through for example reduced do not attend rates, repeat consultations and duplicative diagnostic tests; they have also generated problems during implementation including GP resistance.

The governments of the UK, Italy, Sweden and New Zealand introduced relatively quickly 'internal market' models into their single-payer systems, to transform hierarchies into markets by separating 'purchasers' from 'providers', and enabling 'purchasers' to contract selectively with competing public and private providers so that 'money followed the patient'. This model has largely been abandoned where it has been tried. England, however, has implemented a modified 'internal market' model emphasising patient choice, which has so far had disappointing results. In the Netherlands, it took nearly 20 years to implement successfully the model in which enrollees choose among multiple insurers; but these insurers have so far only realised in part their potential to contract selectively with competing providers. The paper discusses the difficulties of implementing these different models and what England and the Netherlands can learn from each other. This includes exploration, as a thought experiment, of how choice of purchaser might be introduced into the English National Health Service based on lessons from the Netherlands.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

However, there are indications that psychoanalytic treatment can result in cost savings in the long term. In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term psychoanalytic treatment on healthcare utilization and work impairment and calculated the associated societal costs. We assessed healthcare utilization and work impairment of patients before, during, and after long-term psychoanalytic treatment (N = 231). Our results show that the difference in total costs associated with healthcare utilization and work impairment between pre-and post-treatment was (sic)2,444 (U.S.$3,070 using average exchange rates for 2006, the year for which these data were calculated) per person per year. Two years after treatment termination, these cost savings had increased to (sic)3,632 ($4,563) per person per year. This indicates that we can expect decreased consumption of medical care and higher work productivity right after psychoanalytic treatment, but also that long-term psychoanalytic treatment can generate economical benefits in the long run. However, we cannot conclude that all invested costs will be earned back eventually. More research is needed on the cost-effectiveness of psychoanalytic treatment.

Low value was attached to punctuality and room for individual preferences. Nursing homes were generally considered to be detrimental for well-being except for dementia patients without a partner. Overall, long-term care services were thought to produce greatest well-being for the patients 'without a partner' and those 'with dementia'. Individuals combining these two risk factors would benefit the most from all services except transportation which was considered more important for the frail elderly. The results support the notion that long-term care services represent different value for different types of patients and that the value of a service depends upon the social context. Examination of patient profiles confirmed the notion that physical, mental and social vulnerability affect valuation of the services.

Qualitative research is used more often for tailoring interventions towards communities and/or local care practices. This article systematically reviews the contribution of qualitative research in developing tailor-made community-based interventions in primary care evaluated by means of the pragmatic trial methodology. Methods: A systematic search of Pubmed/Medline and Embase revealed 33 articles. Using a literature mapping process, the articles were arranged according to the development phases identified in the MRC framework for the development of complex interventions to improve health. Results: The review showed qualitative research is mainly used to provide insight into the contextual circumstances of the interventions' implementation, delivery and evaluation. To a lesser extent, qualitative research findings are used for tailoring and improving the design of the interventions for a better fit with daily primary care practice. Moreover, most qualitative findings are used for tailoring the interventions' contextual circumstances so that the interventions are performed in practice as planned, rather than adjusted to local circumstances. Conclusions: Pragmatic trials seem to be oxymoronic. Although the pragmatic trial methodology establishes the effectiveness of interventions under natural, non-experimental conditions, no pragmatic fit is allowed. Qualitative research's contribution to the development of tailor-made community-based interventions lies in providing ongoing evaluations of the dilemmas faced in pragmatic trials and allowing for the development of true tailor-made interventions.",tailor-made approach,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

The risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) hospitalizations was compared between psoriasis patients and a matched reference cohort. Additional adjustments were made for healthcare consumption and use of cardiovascular drugs. A total of 15,820 psoriasis patients and 27,577 reference subjects were included, showing an incidence rate of 611 and 559 IHD per 100,000 person-years, respectively (P=0.066). The age- and gender-adjusted risk of IHD was comparable between both cohorts ( hazard ratio (HR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.99-1.23). Before cohort entry, psoriasis patients used more antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering drugs and were more often hospitalized. Adjusting for these confounders decreased the HR for IHD, but it remained comparable between both populations. There was no different risk of IHD between the subgroup of patients who only used topicals versus those who received systemic therapies or inpatient care for their psoriasis. This study, therefore, suggests that psoriasis is not a clinically relevant risk factor for IHD hospitalizations on the population level.",,Dermatology

We searched the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases for articles published between 1971 and 2007. We included English language reports on HCM patients containing follow-up data on the endpoint (sudden) cardiac death using survival analysis. Analysis was undertaken using the quality of reporting of meta-analyses (QUORUM) statement checklist. The quality was checked using a quality assessment form from the Cochrane Collaboration. Thirty studies met inclusion criteria and passed quality assessment. The use of the six major risk factors (previous cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, extreme left ventricular hypertrophy, unexplained syncope, abnormal blood pressure response, and family history of sudden death) in risk stratification for SCD as recommended by international guidelines was supported by the literature. In addition, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction seems associated with a higher risk of SCD. Our systematic review provides sound evidence for the use of the six major risk factors for SCD in the risk stratification of HCM patients. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction could be included in the overall risk profile of patients with a marked left ventricular outflow gradient under basal conditions.",Sudden death,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology

The potential success of this strategy crucially depends on insurers' bargaining leverage vis-A -vis health care providers. An important determinant of insurers' bargaining power is the willingness of consumers to consider alternative providers. In this paper we examine to what extent consumers are willing to switch hospitals when they are fully covered for hospital services, which is typical for many European countries. Since prices do not matter to these patients, we estimate time-elasticities to assess hospital substitutability. Using data from a large Dutch health insurer on non-emergency neurosurgical outpatient hospital visits in 2003, we estimate a conditional logit model of patient hospital choice taking both patient heterogeneity and hospital characteristics into account. We use the parameter estimates to simulate the demand effect of an artificial increase in travel time by 10% for every patient, holding all other hospital attributes constant. Overall, the resulting point estimates of hospitals' time-elasticities are fairly high, although variation is substantial (-2.6 to -1.4). Sensitivity tests reveal that these estimates are very robust and differ significantly across individual hospitals. This implies that all hospitals in our study sample have at least one close substitute which is an important precondition for effective hospital competition.",Health care reform,Health Care Sciences & Services

Disclosure of DNA test results may have social implications such as low access to insurance. In the Netherlands, insurance companies are restricted in the use of genetic information of their clients by the Medical Examination Act. A cross-sectional survey was used to assess the frequency and type of problems encountered by HCM mutation carriers applying for insurance, and associations with carriers' characteristics. The response rate was 86% (228/264). A total of 66 carriers (29%) applied for insurance of whom 39 reported problems (59%) during an average follow-up of 3 years since the DNA test result. More problems were encountered by carriers with manifest disease (P<0.001) and carriers with symptoms of HCM (P=0.049). Carriers identified after predictive DNA testing less frequently experienced problems (P=0.002). Three carriers without manifest HCM reported problems (5% of applicants). Frequently reported problems were higher premium (72%), grant access to medical records (62%), and complete rejection (33%). In conclusion, HCM mutation carriers frequently encounter problems when applying for insurances, often in the case of manifest disease, but the risk assessment of insurance companies is largely justified. Still, 5% of carriers encounter potentially unjustified problems, indicating the necessity to monitor the application of the existing laws and regulations by insurance companies and to educate counselees on the implications of these laws and regulations.

The factors found most often to be significant are team composition, experience and time of the day. Contrary to widespread opinions among surgeons, gender has nearly never a significant effect.

Two of the most important changes relate to the level of education in the population and the balance between work and private life. These days a large percentage of people are highly educated. Partly as a result of economic progress in the 1950s and the 1960s and partly due to the fact that many women entered the labour force, people started searching for ways to combine their career with family obligations and a private life (including hobbies, outings and holidays). Medical professional ethics, more specifically: professional attitudes towards patients and colleagues, is influenced by developments such as these, but how much and in what way? It was assumed that surgery ethics would be more robust, resistant to change and that general practitioner (GP) ethics would change more readily in response to a changing society, because surgeons perform technical work in operating theatres in hospitals whereas GPs have their offices in the midst of society. The journals of Dutch surgeons and GPs from the 1950s onwards were studied so as to detect traces of change in medical professional ethics in The Netherlands. GP ethics turned out to be malleable compared with surgery ethics. In fact, GP medicine proved to be an agent of change rather than merely responding to it, both with regard to the changing role of patients and with regard to the changing work life balance.",,Biomedical Social Sciences

Callon proposes that laws of markets do exist, but mainly because they are performed, shaped and formatted through the way economics develops 'spaces of calculation'. The performativity thesis proposes that if markets are not natural entities, but are instead performed by economics, this may open up the reconfiguration of market practices to many previously excluded actors, including STS scholars. However, Callon's focus on the role of materialities in performing spaces of calculation and the role of economics in creating these materialities, easily leads to over-enthusiasm for the potential of STS scholars to engage in reconfiguring markets. Based on an interventionist research project on performing healthcare markets as 'value'-driven, rather than 'cost-saving'-driven, I argue that markets can 'work' despite the absence of well-functioning materialities. This problematizes the approach pursued by Callon, and I therefore propose to temper the ambitions of STS scholars involved in the reconfiguration of markets to direct them towards the analysis of historically grown prevailing market regimes and market practices as 'forms of the probable' for such reconfiguration. Analysing such probabilities may be fruitful for reflecting on the risks that such experimental interventions entail for reconfiguring markets.",reconfiguration,History & Philosophy of Science

Since demand-side cost sharing is a very controversial issue, the no-claim rebate was launched as a consumer friendly bonus system to reward prudent utilization of health services. Internationally, the introduction of a mandatory no-claim rebate in a social health insurance scheme is unprecedented. Consumers were entitled to an annual rebate of (sic)255 if no claims were made. During the year, all health care expenses except for GP visits and maternity care were deducted from the rebate until the rebate became zero. In this article, we discuss the rationale of the no-claim rebate and the available evidence of its effect. Using a questionnaire in a convenience sample, we examined people's knowledge, attitudes, and sensitivity to the incentive scheme. We find that only 4% of respondents stated that they would reduce consumption because of the no-claim rebate. Respondents also indicated that they were willing to accept a high loss of rebate in order to use a medical treatment. However, during the last month of the year many respondents seemed willing to postpone consumption until the next year in order to keep the rebate of the current year intact. A small majority of respondents considered the no-claim rebate to be unfair. Finally, we briefly discuss why in 2008 the no-claim rebate was replaced by a mandatory deductible.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

Many studies recommend active patient participation in the process of guideline development as the instrument to make guidelines more patient-centred. This is done on the assumption that active patient participation will enhance the quality of the guidelines. We found no empirical evidence, however, to support this assumption. Moreover, the studies show that patients experience several difficulties in the participation process, which cannot solely be traced back to flawed practices. Given this poor track record we conclude that the plea to actively involve patients in the guideline development process should be reconsidered.",Patient-centred medicine,Biomedical Social Sciences

During 16 semistructured face-to-face interviews with both respondent groups, a deeper insight into the dementia care programmes was provided. Project documentation for all the cases was studied. The eight programmes were developed independently to improve the quality and continuity of long-term dementia care. The programmes show overlap in terms of their vision, tasks of case managers, case management process and the participating partners in the local dementia care networks. Differences concern the targeted dementia patient groups as well as the background of the case managers and their position in the local dementia care provider network.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate whether people 1) expect income and leisure to be affected by certain health states, 2) include the effects of ill-health on income and leisure in health state valuations when the measure is silent on both, and 3) what effect this has on these valuations. Data and Methods. A convenience sample of 75 individuals from the general public rated 3 different health states on a visual analogue scale without instruction on the incorporation of income and leisure. Different subgroups were created on the basis of expecting income and leisure to be affected and the indicated incorporation of these effects. Comparative and multivariate analyses were used to analyze the data. Results. The results show that most respondents (69%) did not consider income effects, whereas 61% did consider the effects on leisure. The expected influence of health states on income and leisure differed substantially between respondents. Only the incorporation of leisure proved to be influential in health state valuations. Conclusions. Health state valuation methods that are silent and noninformative regarding leisure and income lead to interrespondent differences regarding how they expect leisure and income to be affected and regarding the inclusion of these effects. This may be especially problematic for leisure if productivity costs are captured at the cost side of the cost-effectiveness ratio.",valuation,Medical Informatics

Proven mutation carriers detected by predictive DNA testing are advised to undergo regular cardiac follow-up according to international guidelines. We evaluated the opinion of 143 predictively tested HCM mutation carriers on received cardiogenetic care using questionnaires (response rate 86%). Predictive genetic counseling and DNA testing were evaluated on four domains: information provision, satisfaction with counseling, social pressure in DNA testing and regret of DNA testing. Opinions on cardiac follow-up were assessed pertaining to communication, nervous anticipation, reassurance, and general disadvantages. Genetic counseling was valued positively and only four carriers would rather not have known that they were a mutation carrier. A majority received their DNA test result by mail or telephone, and almost all were satisfied. Only 76% of carriers received regular cardiac follow-up. Those who did, had a positive attitude regarding the cardiac visits. General disadvantages of the visits were valued as low, especially by older carriers, men and carriers with manifest HCM. We conclude that our adapted Huntington guidelines are well accepted and that cardiogenetic care is generally appreciated by predictively tested HCM mutation carriers. To better understand the cause of the substantial portion of mutation carriers not receiving regular cardiac follow-up, although recommended in international guidelines, further research is needed.

Among the frequently reported workflow advantages were the legible orders, remote accessibility of the systems, and the shorter order turnaround times. Among the frequently reported disadvantages were the time-consuming and problematic user-system interactions, and the enforcement of a predefined relationship between clinical tasks and between providers.

Ghanaian women (n 54) had higher proportions of EPA and DHA, but generally lower proportions of n-6 fatty acids (P<0.001). Differences were most pronounced in Turkish and Ghanaian women, who, by means of a simple questionnaire, reported the lowest and highest fish consumption respectively. Adjustment for fish intake, however, hardly attenuated the differences in relative EPA, DHA, DGLA and AA concentrations between the various ethnic groups.

In the daily practice of the Thorax Centre case study setting, the planning focuses on optimal use of operating theatre time, though the performance of the Thorax Centre as a whole is often more limited by other resources. For operating theatres a master surgical schedule is used to allocate operating theatre resources at tactical level for a longer period. Operational schedules at weekly level are derived from this master schedule. Within cardiothoracic surgery different categories of patients can be distinguished based on their requirement of resources. The mix of patients operated is, therefore, an important decision variable for the Thorax Centre to manage the use of these resources. In this paper we will consider the planning problem at the tactical level to generate a master surgical schedule that realises a given target of patient throughput and optimises an objective function for the utilisation of resources. The problem can be mathematically approached by mixed integer linear programming, which we already demonstrated in a previous paper. The specific topic of the current paper is to investigate the influence of using a stochastic instead of a deterministic length of stay. We will discuss the new mathematical model developed for this planning problem. The results obtained by the model indicate that we can generate master surgical schedules with a better performance on target utilization levels of resources by considering the stochastic length of stay.",Integer linear programming,Health Care Sciences & Services

Quality of life and psychological distress were found to be impaired in HCM patients but have never been assessed in mutation carriers, with or without manifest HCM. We aimed to assess quality of life and psychological distress, using standardized questionnaires, and to identify sociodemographic, clinical, risk and illness perception related predictors thereof in 228 HCM mutation carriers. HCM carriers' overall quality of life and distress scores did not differ from the Dutch population. Quality of life and distress were worst in carriers with manifest HCM before DNA testing and best in predictively tested carriers without HCM. The latter group had even significantly better quality of life than the general population. Substantial determinants of impaired physical quality of life were symptoms (beta = 5.2, P = 0.001) and stronger belief in serious consequences of carriership, (beta = 3.5, P < 0.001); determinants of impaired mental quality of life were physical comorbidity (beta = 3.0, P = 0.020) and a higher perceived risk of symptoms (beta = 0.9, P = 0.001). Female gender (beta = 1.4, P = 0.004) and stronger emotional reactions (beta = 1.2, P = 0.002) were associated with more anxiety. Less understanding of carriership (beta = 0.9, P = 0.007) and stronger belief in serious consequences (beta = 0.8, P = 0.008) increased depression. Levels of quality of life and distress were not impaired compared to the Dutch population. Illness and risk perception related variables were major determinants of quality of life and distress. Because these variables can be addressed and adjusted during pre- and post-test counseling, genetic counseling should focus on these determinants.

Methods: 59 Patients were evaluated with a validated questionnaire, clinical examination, AFT and endosonography. Results: Women with POP showed lower squeezing pressure, postponed first sensation and desire, lower capacity and prolonged pudendal nerve terminal latency time compared to healthy controls (all p < 0.01). Manometric findings did not differ significantly between patients with and without constipation. Patients with fecal incontinence had significantly lower resting and squeezing pressures than patients without fecal incontinence and an increased risk of an external sphincter defect (odds ratio = 12.75, 95% confidence interval 2.40-66.67). Although digital rectal examination could quantify absent, decreased and normal squeezing pressure, the positive predictive value for external sphincter defects was low (0.32). Conclusion: AFT indicates the presence of neuromuscular damage of the anorectal region in patients with POP. AFT is not useful in the work-up of patients with POP and constipation, because it fails to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. In cases of fecal incontinence, AFT and endosonography are helpful to distinguish between functional and anatomical problems. Copyright (C) 2008 S.

To increase the effectiveness, this paper proposes to shift the deductible range to [s(i),s(i)+d], with starting point s(i) depending on relevant risk characteristics of individual i. In an empirical illustration we assume the optimal shift to be such that the variance in out-of-pocket expenditures is maximized. Results indicate that for the 10-percent highest risks in our data the optimal starting point of a (sic) 1000-deductible is to be found (far) beyond (sic) 1200, which corresponds with a deductible range of [1200,2200] or further. We conclude that, compared to traditional deductibles, shifted deductibles with a risk-adjusted starting point lower out-of-pocket expenditures and may further reduce moral hazard.

So far, however, the effects of this strategy remain unclear. Although current models define the concept of disease management, they do not provide a systematic development or an explanatory theory of how disease management affects the outcomes of care. The objective of this paper is to present a framework for valid evaluation of disease-management initiatives. The evaluation model is built on two pillars of disease management: patient-related and professional-directed interventions. The effectiveness of these interventions is thought to be affected by the organisational design of the healthcare system. Disease management requires a multifaceted approach; hence disease-management programme evaluations should focus on the effects of multiple interventions, namely patient-related, professional-directed and organisational interventions. The framework has been built upon the conceptualisation of these disease-management interventions. Analysis of the underlying mechanisms of these interventions revealed that learning and behavioural theories support the core assumptions of disease management. The evaluation model can be used to identify the components of disease-management programmes and the mechanisms behind them, making valid comparison feasible. In addition, this model links the programme interventions to indicators that can be used to evaluate the disease-management programme. Consistent use of this framework will enable comparisons among disease-management programmes and outcomes in evaluation research.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

In 97 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy families with a sarcomere gene mutation we retrospectively determined uptake of genetic counselling and predictive DNA testing in relatives within 1 year after the detection of the causal mutation in the proband. Uptake of genetic counselling was 39% and did not differ significantly by proband's or relative's gender, nor by young age of the relative (<18 years) or a family history positive for sudden cardiac death.

When health varies over time, the standard quality-adjusted life year model operates under the assumptions of time utility independence within each health state and additive independence between health states. These assumptions can be relaxed by an integral assessment of disease severity over time. The authors present the annual profile method (APM), which values health profiles on a 1-year base, and test the APM for feasibility, consistency, and test-retest reliability. Methods. A population panel, general practitioners, medical advisers, and a panel of the Dutch Consumers Association valued vignettes for 46 disease stages using the visual analog scale (VAS) and time tradeoff (TTO) methods. Vignettes contained disease-specific information, a generic description (EQ-6D5L), a description of the disease course over time, and a visual representation of the disease. Feasibility was tested by missing and inconsistent responses. Consistency between and within panels was tested with a generalizability study, analysis of variance, and standard correlation coefficients. Test-retest reliability was tested with a generalizability study and intraclass correlation coefficients. Results. Missing and inconsistent responses were < 2.6%.

Results from WHO's general population surveys of ""health systems responsiveness"" in 41 countries","Quality of care research has reached some agreement on concepts like structure, process and outcome, and non-clinical versus clinical processes of care. These concepts are commonly explored through surveys measuring patient experiences, yet few surveys have focused on patient, or ""user"", priorities across different quality dimensions. Population surveys on priorities can contribute to, although not replace participation in, policy decision making. Using 105,806 survey interview records from the World Health Organization's (WHO's) general population surveys in 41 countries, this paper describes the relative importance of eight domains in the non-clinical quality of care concept WHO calls ""health systems responsiveness"". Responsiveness domains are divided into interpersonal domains (dignity, autonomy, communication and confidentiality) and structural domains (quality of basic amenities, choice, access to social support networks and prompt attention). This paper explores variations in domain importance by countrylevel variables (country of residence, human development, health system expenditure, and ""geographic zones"") and by subpopulations defined by sex, age, education, health status, and utilization. Most respondents selected prompt attention as the most important domain. Dignity was selected second, followed by communication. Access to social support networks was identified as the least important domain. In general, convergence in rankings was stronger across subpopulations within countries than across countries. Yet even across diverse countries, there was more convergence than divergence in views. These results provide a ranking of quality of care criteria for consideration during health reform processes further to the usual emphasis on clinical quality and supply-side efficiency.

However, evidence from recent reimbursement decisions in several jurisdictions points to residual, unexplained variables, among which is budget impact. Budget impact refers to the total costs that drug reimbursement and use entail with respect to one part of the health care system, pharmaceutical care, or to the entire health care system, taking into account the possible reallocation of resources across budgets or sectors of the health care system. The economic and equity rationale for carrying out budget impact analyses is opportunity cost, or benefits forgone, measured in terms of utility or equitable distribution, by using resources in one way rather than another. In other words, by choosing to draw down the budget in one way, decision makers forgo other opportunities to use the same resources. Under a set of unrealistic assumptions, cost-effectiveness analysis accounts for opportunity cost while conveying to the decision maker the price of maximizing health gains, subject to a budget or resource constraint. However, the underlying assumptions are implausible, particularly in the context of pharmaceutical care. Moreover, budget impact analysis is more useful to the decision maker than cost-effectiveness analysis if the objective is not to maximize health gains subject to a budget or resource constraint, but to reduce variance in health gains. With respect to equitable distribution, budget impact analyses lay bare the individuals or groups who lose out-those who bear the opportunity cost of spending resources in accordance with one decision rule rather than another.",,Biomedical Social Sciences

In a theoretical analysis, we discuss the consequences of equalizing three types of expenditures: the net claims that are reimbursed by the insurer, the out-of-pocket expenditures and the expenditure savings due to moral hazard reduction. Equalizing only the net claims, as done in Switzerland, creates incentives for cream skimming and prevents insurers from incorporating out-of-pocket expenditures and moral hazard reductions into their premium structure. In an empirical analysis, we examine the effect of self-selection and conclude that the Swiss and Dutch risk equalization systems do not fully adjust for differences in health status between those who choose a deductible and those who do not. We discuss how this may lead to incentives for cream skimming and to a reduction of cross-subsidies from healthy to unhealthy individuals compared to a situation without voluntary deductibles.

Health insurers can influence provider choice by offering insurance contracts with restricted provider networks. Alternatively, they can offer contracts with unrestricted access and use incentives to motivate consumers to visit preferred providers. Little is known, however, about the effectiveness of this alternative strategy of consumer channeling. Using data from two natural experiments in the Dutch pharmacy market, we examine how consumers respond to incentives used by health insurers to influence their choice of provider. We find that consumers are sensitive to rather small incentives and that temporary incentives may sort a long-term effect on provider choice. In addition, we find that both consumer and provider characteristics determine whether consumers are willing to switch to preferred pharmacies.

However, little is known about the reproducibility of MRI in the assessment of uterine fibroids. This study evaluates the inter- and intraobserver variation in the assessment of the uterine fibroids and concomitant adenomyosis in women scheduled for uterine artery embolization (UAE). Forty patients (mean age: 44.5 years) with symptomatic uterine fibroids who were scheduled for UAE underwent T-1- and T-2-weighted MRI. To study inter- and intraobserver agreement 40 MR images were evaluated independently by two observers and reevaluated by both observers 4 months later. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was calculated using Cohen's kappa statistic and intraclass correlation coefficient for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Inter-observer agreement for uterine volumes (kappa = 0.99, p < 0.0001), dominant fibroid volumes (kappa = 0.98, p <= 0.0001), and number of fibroids (kappa = 0.88; CI, 0.77-0.93; p < 0.0001) was excellent. For the T-1- and T-2-weighted signal intensity of the dominant fibroid there was good agreement between the observers (87%; 95% CI, 71.9%-95.6%) and the intraobserver agreement was good for observer A (95%; 95% CI, 83.1%-99.4%) and moderate for observer B (kappa = 0.47). The interobserver agreement with respect to the presence of adenomyosis was good (kappa = 0.73, p < 0.0001), while both intraobserver agreements were fair to moderate (observer A, kappa = 0.55, p = 0.0003; and observer B, kappa = 0.66, p < 0.0001).

Yet, new questions have arisen. To mention one, health care budgets have tightened. It follows that the effects of medical interventions should be weighted against their costs. As evidence was particularly sparse, we set out to analyse cost-effectiveness of neonatal surgery. The purpose of this article is to summarise our findings and to review recent studies. Moreover, this article explains the relevance of cost-effectiveness analysis and explores how cost-effectiveness interacts with other determinants of health care priority setting. Our research revealed that treatments for two common diagnostic categories in neonatal surgery (congenital anorectal malformations and congenital diaphragmatic hernia) produce good cost-effectiveness. Other groups also published cost-effectiveness studies in the field of neonatal surgery, although their number is still small. Contemporaneously, the economic aspects of health care have captured the interest of policy makers. Importantly, this is not to say that there are no other factors playing a role in priority setting, foremost among which are ethical questions and arguments of equity. This article concludes that, according to present evidence, neonatal surgery yields good value for money and contributes to equity in health.",priority setting,Surgery

The comparison focuses on three questions: what outcome measures are available for including informal care in economic evaluations of healthcare programmes; whether these measures are compatible with the common types of economic evaluation; and, when applying these measures, whether all relevant aspects of informal care are incorporated. All types of economic evaluation can incorporate a monetary value of informal care (using the opportunity cost method, the proxy good method, CVM and CM) on the cost side of an analysis, but only when the relevant aspects of time costs have been valued. On the effect side of a cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis, the health effects (for the patient and/or caregiver) measured in natural units or QALYs can be combined with cost estimates based on the opportunity cost method or the proxy good method. One should be careful when incorporating CVM and CM in cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, as the health effects of patients receiving informal care and the carers themselves may also have been valued separately. One should determine whether the caregiver valuation exercise allows combination with other valuation techniques. In cost-benefit analyses, CVM and CM appear to be the best tools for the valuation of informal care. When researchers decide to use the well-being method, we recommend applying it in a cost-benefit analysis framework. This method values overall QOL (happiness); hence it is broader than just HR-QOL, which complicates inclusion in traditional health economic evaluations that normally define outcomes more narrowly. Using broader, non-monetary valuation techniques, such as the CarerQol instrument, requires a broader evaluation framework than cost-effectiveness/cost-utility analysis, such as cost-consequence or multi-criteria analysis.",,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

The present paper provides a cost comparison of dental filling procedures across nine European countries. More specifically, the paper aims to estimate the costs and prices (i.e. reimbursement fees) of a single dental filling procedure in an approximately 12-year-old child with a toothache in a lower molar who presents at a dental practice, as described in a case vignette. Both amalgam and composite fillings were examined. Total costs were determined by identifying resource use and unit costs for the following cost components: diagnostic procedures, labour, materials, drugs, and overheads. Altogether, 49 practices provided data for the cost calculations. Mean total costs per country varied considerably, ranging from (sic)8 to (sic)156. Labour costs were the most important cost driver in all practices, comprising 58% of total costs. Overhead costs were the second-most important cost component in the majority of countries. Actual cost differences across practices within countries were relatively small. Cost variations between countries were primarily due to differences in unit costs, especially for labour and overheads, and only to a lesser extent to differences in resource use. Finally, cost estimates for a single dental filling procedure based on reimbursement fees led to an underestimation of the total costs by approximately 50%.

Alternative, less formal methods historically employed in the hospital industry have proven inaccurate; these methods were even called inapplicable in a recent US court decision. In this paper, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of several new approaches to defining hospital markets that are suggested in the recent economic literature. In particular, we discuss the applicability of the time-elasticity approach, competitor-share approach, and option-demand approach to the recently partly deregulated Dutch hospital market.

We use an example of a smoking-cessation intervention to highlight the consequences of different practices of accounting for costs and effects in economic evaluations. Only inclusion of all costs and effects of unrelated medical care in life-years gained can be considered both intemally and externally consistent. Including or excluding unrelated future medical costs may have important distributional consequences, especially for interventions that substantially increase length of life. Regarding practical objections against inclusion of future costs, it is important to note that it is becoming increasingly possible to accurately estimate unrelated medical costs in life-years gained.

Using two types of data (discursive data from websites and promotional items, and supplementary data from interviews and ethnographic observations carried out with those working to sustain these initiatives), we examine how users are directly addressed and discussed.

The following indi cations were considered: haematological malignancies (acute leukaemias, myeloproliferative disorders, lymphoproliferative disorders and multiple myeloma), solid tumours and non-malignant diseases. Numbers of patients treated from 1990 to 2004 were extracted from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation database, extrapolated to 2012 using mathematic models and adjusted to the literature study and expert opinion. In Europe, a 13% raise in HSCTutilisation is to be expected from 2005 to 2010, mostly due to the growing application of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens followed by allogeneic HSCT. Growing transplant rates are likely to exert health expenditure budgets and put presOncology sure on health care providers and health insurers in Europe. Therefore, the rapid expansion would ideally imply a simultaneous increase in HSCT budgets. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",scenario analysis,Oncology

In a randomized controlled clinical trial the current diagnostic practice, i.e. all patients undergo direct laryngoscopy, will be compared to a strategy in which FDG-PET selects the patients for laryngoscopy. All eight head and neck cancer centers of the Dutch Head and Neck Oncology Cooperative Group NWHHT will participate in this multicenter trial. The study population consists of patients with clinical suspicion of recurrent T2-T4 laryngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy (without obvious signs of tumor) in whom a direct laryngoscopy under general anesthesia with taking of biopsies is indicated by the local physician. The primary efficacy endpoint is the difference in the number of futile indications for direct laryngoscopy between the conventional diagnostic arm and the FDG-PET based diagnostic arm. An indication for laryngoscopy is classified as futile if this laryngoscopy was negative and no recurrence was diagnosed within 6 months follow-up (gold standard). The FDG-PET based strategy may increase the risk of missing recurrent tumor compared to current practice. Safety endpoints include survival and morbidity due to laryngoscopy with taking of biopsies. Survival rates of both groups will have to be collected outside the time frame of the funded trial. Resectability of recurrent tumor and tumor negative surgical margins after total laryngectomy will be used as proxy endpoints. The trial will also compare quality of life and direct medical costs between both arms. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",quality of life,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Because of its formal status and nationwide regulation, conditional reimbursement may allow governments to better control medical decision-making. To evaluate the effects of conditional reimbursement on medicine use and its performance as a policy tool, we compared observed volumes of medicine use with expected volumes. In addition, we mapped the annual growth by analysing trends in the volumes of use of all conditionally reimbursed drugs; starting with the year the drug entered the market (using macro-level data). Next we explored five cases in depth (using micro-level data) in order to explore what fraction of individual prescriptions met the requirements. We also performed qualitative research (document analysis, interviews (N=65)) in order to obtain the stakeholders' perspectives on how the measure functions, as well as to interpret the case studies data further. The findings suggest that conditional reimbursement may be an effective policy instrument, but that several changes are needed to optimize its impact. These changes are predominantly related to transparency (e.g. conditions are set following clear procedures and criteria), legitimacy (conditions should be consistent with criteria for prioritization), feasibility of procedures to control appropriate use, and timely and appropriate commitment of the stakeholders.

An empirical analysis for orthopaedic care and neurosurgery in the Netherlands,"Using data for 2003, we find that both for non-emergency orthopaedic care (38%) and neurosurgery (54%) numerous Dutch patients did not visit the nearest hospital. Our estimation results show that extra travel time negatively influences the probability of hospital bypassing. Good waiting time performance by the nearest hospital also significantly decreases the likelihood of a bypass decision. Patients seem to place a lower negative value on extra travel time for orthopaedic care than for neurosurgery. The valuation of shorter waiting time also varies between these two types of hospital care. A good performance of the nearest hospital on waiting time decreases the likelihood of a bypass decision most for neurosurgery. In both samples, patients are more likely to bypass the nearest hospital when it is a university medical centre or a tertiary teaching hospital. Patient attributes, such as age and social status, are also found to significantly affect hospital bypassing. From our analysis it follows that both patient and hospital care heterogeneity should be taken into account when assessing the substitutability of hospitals.",hospital competition,Health Care Sciences & Services

This article aims to assess to what extent trachoma is a disease of the poor, and trachoma services reach the poor in Tanzania and Vietnam. Methods: Individual level data on trachoma prevalence (active trachoma and trichiasis) and utilization of trachoma-related services were collected in both countries in 2004. Prevalence data were also available for Vietnam in 2001. We used household level data to construct an asset index as our living standards measure. Next, we related trachoma prevalence and service use to living standards, and used concentration indices to summarize and test the degree of inequality. Results: Trachoma prevalence was higher among the poorest groups in Tanzania. No such relation could be established in Vietnam where prevalence declined over the period 2001-2004 and particularly so among the least poor. Antibiotics were used more by the poorest in Tanzania and by the less poor in Vietnam. In both countries, there was no unequivocal pattern for the relation between living standards and the use of trachoma services. Conclusions: Trachoma is found to be a disease of the poorest in Tanzania, but not in Vietnam. In the latter country there are indications that district characteristics have an important impact on trachoma prevalence. The higher use of antibiotics among the better-off in Vietnam may have contributed to their larger decline in active trachoma prevalence between 2001 and 2004 compared to the poorer segments.",Vietnam,Ophthalmology

There is no evidence for the effectiveness of these criteria. We evaluated the predictive value of patient characteristics that are used in the Dutch IVF,guideline and developed a model that predicts the IVF ongoing pregnancy chance within 12 months. METHODS: In a national prospective cohort study, pregnancy chances after IVF and ICSI treatment were assessed. Couples eligible for IVF or ICSI were followed during 12 months, using the databases of 11 IVF centres and 20 transport IVF clinics. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate the cumulative probability of an ongoing pregnancy, and Cox regression was used for assessing the effects of predictors of pregnancy. RESULTS: 4928 couples starting IVF/ICSI treatment were prospectively followed. On average, couples had 1.8 cycles in 12 months for both IVF and ICSI. The 1-year probability of ongoing pregnancy was 44.8% (95% CI 42.1-47.5%). ICSI for severe oligospermia had a significantly higher ongoing pregnancy rate than IVF indicated treatments, with a multivariate Hazard ratio (HR) of 1.22 (95% CI 1.07-1.39). The success rates were comparable for all diagnostic categories of IVF. The highest success rate is at age 30, with a slight decline towards younger women and women up to 35 and a sharp drop after 35. Primary subfertility with a HR of 0.90 (95% CI 0.83-0.99) and duration of subfertility with a HR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99) per year significantly affected the pregnancy chance. CONCLUSIONS: The most important predictors of the pregnancy chance after IVF and ICSI are women's age and ICSI. The diagnostic category is of no consequence. Duration of subfertility and pregnancy history are of limited prognostic value.",prognostic factors,Reproductive Biology

An economic evaluation alongside a randomized clinical trial in primary care. A total of 135 patients were randomly allocated to physical therapy added to general practitioners' care ( n = 67) or to general practitioners' care alone ( n = 68). Objective. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of physical therapy and general practitioner care for patients with an acute lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS, also called sciatica) compared with general practitioner care only. Summary of Background Data. There is a lack of knowledge concerning the cost-effectiveness of physical therapy in patients with sciatica. Methods. The clinical outcomes were global perceived effect and quality of life. The direct and indirect costs were measured by means of questionnaires. The follow-up period was 1 year. The Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio ( ICER) between both study arms was constructed. Confidence intervals for the ICER were calculated using Fieller's method and using bootstrapping. Results. There was a significant difference on perceived recovery at 1-year follow-up in favor of the physical therapy group. The additional physical therapy did not have an incremental effect on quality of life. At 1-year follow-up, the ICER for the total costs was epsilon 6224 (95% confidence interval, -10419, 27551) per improved patient gained. For direct costs only, the ICER was epsilon 837 ( 95% confidence interval, -731, 3186). Conclusion.

The current service concept of hospital admission planning aims at optimising the use of scarce hospital resources without paying much attention to the level of service offered to patients. As patients nowadays do not accept long waiting times for hospital admission, it becomes necessary to consider alternative admission service concepts. Waiting lists have also become a political issue, and alternative concepts have been advocated such as giving all patients an appointment for admission. A simulation model was built to examine the impacts of extreme admission service concepts in a simplified hospital setting. The alternative concepts considered are based on the 'zero waiting time' principle (immediate treatment), and the 'booked admissions' principle (using an appointment for admission). The results of these admission service concepts are compared with the results of the current concept, based on the 'maximising resource use' principle. The paper deals with the development of a framework and tool that allows evaluating different, somehow conflicting, hospital admission planning concepts and the usefulness of such framework and tool for more refined/real-life approaches to hospital admission planning.

Objective The aim of this study was to assess the direct medical costs of patients suffering from ADHD and their quality of life as well as the direct medical costs of their mothers. Study design We selected a group of 70 children who were being treated by a paediatrician for ADHD based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD. For comparison's sake, we also included a non-matched group of 35 children with behaviour problems and 60 children with no behaviour problem from a large school population-based study on the detection of ADHD. We collected information on the health care utilisation of the children applying the Trimbos and iMTA questionnaire on Costs associated with Psychiatric illness' (TiC-P). Their health related quality of life was collected by using the Dutch 50-item parent version of the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ PF50). Measurements were at baseline and at 6 months. Subsequently, we collected data on the health utilisation of the mothers and their production losses due to absence from work and reduced efficiency. Results The mean direct medical costs per ADHD patient per year were (sic)2040 or (sic)1173 when leaving out one patient with a long-term hospital admission, compared to (sic)288 for the group of children with behaviour problems and (sic)177 for the group of children with no behaviour problems. The direct medical costs for children who had psychiatric co-morbidities were significantly higher compared to children with ADHD alone. The mean medical costs per year for the mothers of the ADHD patients were significantly higher than for the mothers of the children with behaviour problems and the mothers of children with no behaviour problems respectively (sic)728, (sic)202 and (sic)154. The physical summary score showed no significant differences between the groups. However, the score on the Psychosocial Summary Score dimension was significantly lower for ADHD patients compared to the scores of the children in the two other samples. The mean annual indirect costs due to absence from work and reduced efficiency at work were (sic)243 for the mothers of the ADHD patients compared to (sic)408 for the mothers of children with behaviour problems and (sic)674 for the mothers of children with no behaviour problems. Conclusion Our study showed that the direct medical costs of ADHD patients were relatively high.

A systematic literature review was carried out using MEDLINE 1966-2006 and EMBASE 1980-2006. The meta-analysis was performed using Cochrane review manager software (RevMan version 4.2; Oxford, UK). Thirteen studies were examined. Results for African descent men (n = 9 studies) and women (n = 7) indicated that African men and women had a higher mean PP than their White counterparts. Overall weighted mean difference (WMD) in PP was 1.68 (95% confidence interval: [ 0.38, 2.98 mm Hg]; P = 0.01) in men and 2.01 ([0.39, 3.63 mm Hg]; P < 0.001) in women. South Asian men ( n = 7 studies) had a lower mean PP than White men (-1.94; [-3.56, -0.32mm Hg]; P = 0.02), whereas no significant difference was found between South Asian and White women (n = 5 studies) (-0.40; [-3.22, 2.39 mm Hg]; P = 0.77). Separate data were available for Indians (n = 5 studies), Bangladeshis (n = 4) and Pakistanis ( n = 3). Bangladeshis had a lower PP than Whites (men, -5.61; [-6.87, -4.36 mm Hg]; P = 0.001) (women, -5.21; [-8.67, -1.75 mm Hg]; P = 0.003).

The WMD was nonsignificantly lower in Indian men (-0.76 mm Hg), Indian women (-0.80 mm Hg) and Pakistani women (-2.06 mm Hg). The higher PP found among African descent people may contribute to their more frequent hypertension complications. However, the lower PP in South Asian populations, particularly in Bangladeshis and Pakistani men, indicates that PP is unlikely to contribute to their higher risk of cardiovascular disease in the UK.",blood pressure,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology

A probabilistic Markov model was designed wherein patients moved between moderate, severe or very severe COPD and had the risk of exacerbation and death. Probabilities were derived from clinical trials. Spanish healthcare utilisation, costs and utilities were estimated for each COPD and exacerbation state. Outcomes were exacerbations, exacerbation-free months, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost(-effectiveness). The mean (SE) 5-year number of exacerbations was 3.50 (0.14) for tiotropium, 4.16 (0.40) for salmeterol and 4.71 (0.54) for ipratropium. The mean (SE) number of QALYs was 3.15 (0.08), 3.02 (0.15) and 3.00 (0.20), respectively. Mean (SE) 5-year costs were sic6,424 (sic305) for tiotropium, sic5,869 (sic505) for salmeterol, and sic5,181 (sic682) for ipratropium (2005 values). Ipratropium, and tiotropium formed the cost-effectiveness frontier, with tiotropium being preferred when willingness to pay (WTP) exceeded sic639 per exacerbation-free month and sic8,157 per QALY. In Spain, tiotropium demonstrated the highest expected net benefit for ratios of the willingness to pay per QALY, well within accepted limits.",Spain,Health Care Sciences & Services

Differences in wage rate or availability of non-labour income (financial support from families and savings) may influence how individuals allocate their time between work and leisure. An increase in wage rate may induce income effects (leisure time demanded increases) and substitution effects (leisure time demanded decreases) whereas an increase in non-labour income only induces income effects. We explored the effects of differences in wage rate and non-labour income on the allocation of time in HIV-infected patients. Patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) provided information on their time allocation, i.e. number of hours worked in 1998. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to test for income and substitution effects. Our results indicate that (i) the allocation of time in HIV-infected patients does not differ with level of education (i.e., wage rate), and that (ii) availability of non-labour income induces income effects, i.e. individuals demand more leisure time.

Insured persons reported slightly higher WTP values than uninsured. About two-thirds of the sample agreed to pay at least 1%; about half the sample was willing to pay at least 1.35%; 30% was willing to pay about 2.0% of annual HH income as health insurance premium. Nominal WTP correlates positively with income but relative WTP (expressed as percent of HH income) correlates negatively. The correlation between WTP and education is secondary to that of WTP with HH income. Household composition did not affect WTP. However, HHs that experienced a high-cost health event and male respondents reported slightly higher WTP. The observed nominal levels of WTP are higher than has been estimated hitherto.

The inclusion of such costs is likely to be of consequence in the case of primary prevention. This paper presents different strategies regarding the inclusion not only of the costs, but also of the health effects of unrelated medical care in economic evaluations. Four different cost-utility ratios are presented and related to the criterion of internal consistency. In addition, the possibility to relate the ratios to a well-posed decision problem is analysed. An example computes the different ratios for smoking cessation interventions in different age groups. Including health care costs of unrelated medical care in life years gained increases cost utility ratios, but excluding unrelated medical costs favours smoking cessation interventions targeted at older smokers over those at younger smokers. We conclude that for primary prevention only a cost utility ratio that includes both the costs and effects of unrelated medical care meets the criterion of internal consistency and is related to a meaningful decision problem. Therefore, this type of cost-utility ratio should be preferred even if the data requirements may be substantial. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",modelling,Health Care Sciences & Services

We investigated the association of social-environmental and individual-level factors with soft drink consumption in a Dutch adolescent sample. Data were gathered in a longitudinal Dutch adolescent sample (n = 208, 62% girls). Soft drink consumption, social cognitions from the Theory of Planned Behaviour and parenting practices towards limited soft drink intake, and Big Five personality dimensions were assessed. Data were analyzed using three-step linear regression analyses. Effect sizes were used as the informational source for the explanatory value of the model. Interaction terms were computed to test the individual-environment interaction. Attitude and subjective norm were significantly associated with soft drink consumption. When controlling for social cognitions, the distal variables parenting practices and the personality dimension Agreeableness remained significantly associated with soft drink consumption. Agreeableness moderated the association of parenting practices with adolescent soft drink consumption. Standardized regression coefficients ranged from 0.16 to 0.24 and explained 14% of the variance in soft drink consumption, indicating a medium effect size. Stricter parenting practices were associated with less soft drink consumption and these effects were moderated by adolescent personality. The direct effects of practices and personality are noteworthy from a theoretical perspective.

In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework to assess the probability that insurers will use SI for favourable risk-selection in BI. We apply our framework to five countries in which risk-selection via SI is feasible: Belgium, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. For each country, we review the available evidence of SI being used as selection device. We find that the probability that SI is and will be used for risk-selection substantially varies across countries. Finally, we discuss several strategies for policy makers to reduce the chance that SI will be used for risk-selection in BI markets.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

We investigated whether the results of the Dutch breast cancer screening programme can be optimised by replacing the standard referral strategy by consensus. Twenty-six screening radiologists independently and blinded to outcome read a test set consisting of previous screening mammograms of 250 cases (screen-detected and interval cancers) and 250 controls. Their referral recommendations were paired and, in case of discrepancy, re-read according to three referral strategies: (1) decision by one of the readers; (2) arbitration by a third reader; (3) referral if both readers agree (consensus). Data allowed studying other referral strategies, including referral if any reader suggests, as well. Double reading with referral if any reader suggests resulted in a 1.03 times higher sensitivity (76.6%) and a 1.31 times higher referral rate (1.26%) than double reading with consensus. To estimate the cost-effectiveness, the outcomes were used in a microsimulation model. Even if double reading with referral if any reader suggests results in four times as high referral rates and an accompanying increase of biopsies or other invasive procedures, the cost-effectiveness of 4,190euro per life-year gained may well be in the range of acceptable cost-effectiveness for Dutch health care programmes.",screening,Oncology

VWF contains several carbohydrate structures, including O-linked glycans that primarily consist of sialylated T antigen (NeuAc(alpha 2-3)Gal-(beta 1-3)-[NeuAc(alpha 2-6)]GaINAc). It is not yet known whether O-linked carbohydrates affect VWF levels. We developed an immunosorbent assay based on neuraminidase incubation allowing subsequent binding of peanut agglutinin (PNA) to desialylated O-linked T antigen on VWF. An inverse relation was found between PNA binding and VWF antigen levels in healthy individuals (n = 111; Pearson rank = -0.43; P <.001). A similar inverse association was observed in randomly selected plasma samples from our diagnostic laboratory: 252% +/- 125% for VWF levels less than 0.5 U/mL (n = 15); 131% +/- 36% for VWF levels between 0.5 and 1.5 U/mL (n = 32); and 92% +/- 40% for VWF levels more than 1.5 U/mL (n = 19). Reduced or increased PNA binding was also observed in patients with increased (liver cirrhosis) or reduced (von Willebrand disease [VWD] type 1) VWF antigen levels, respectively. VWD type 1 patients further displayed increased ratios of propeptide over mature VWF antigen levels (0.38 +/- 0.18 versus 0.17 +/- 0.03 for patients and controls, respectively; P <.001), which is indicative of reduced VWF survival in these patients. Of interest, a linear relation between PNA binding and propeptide/VWF ratio was observed (Spearman rank = 0.47), suggesting a potential association between O-linked glycosylation and VWF survival. Finally, we detected a marked decrease in PNA binding in post-DDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) samples from various patients, indicating that the O-linked glycosylation profile of VWF stored in endothelial storage orgainelles may differ from circulating VWF.",,Hematology

NICE (and other regulatory bodies) should either use differential discounting or stipulate how the changing value of health should otherwise be dealt with.

Understanding bow gender influences health care utilization is still unresolved. We developed a model that could explain these gender-related differences. The possible pathways assumed by this model that relate gender to utilization, can be summarized as follows: (1) utilization may be influenced by somatic morbidity, mental distress, perceived symptoms, poor subjective health and propensity to use services; (2) women have higher levels of these variables than men (mediating effect); and (3) the direct effects of some of these variables on utililization are moderated by gender, i.e. they are stronger for women than for men (moderating effect). Data were drawn from a community-based sample of adult enrollees of a sickness fund in the Netherlands, who had responded to a mailed health survey (N = 8698). This survey contained questions on somatic morbidity, mental distress and other mediating variables. Health care utilization was measured prospectively, using data extracted from a claims database held by the sickness fund that covers all types of general health services except general practitioner consultations. The model was tested using structural equation modelling. Women reported more somatic morbidity and mental distress than men did, as well as elevated levels of other mediating variables, which might explain-at least partly-gender related differences in utilization. Differences in propensity to use services were not found. The expected moderating effect of gender could not be demonstrated. That is, we did not find gender related differences in the strength of the relations between mental distress, other mediating variables and utilization. Mental distress is related to utilization in a way that is not gender specific, however, because women report higher levels of mental distress (as well as somatic morbidity), this results in a greater utilization of somatic health care services.

In 13% of the patients, the sick funds did cover treatment as the forum advised them to do, but according to guideline criteria it may be unlikely that these patients have growth hormone deficiency. According to the LRG, however, only 2% of the decisions are inconsistent with the guidelines, as some criteria on what to do in case of more uncertainty, shifted. For the forum, it seems rather unthinkable to go against the professional norms, in spite of formal national regulations. For the Health Care Insurance Board (CVZ), it was not considered possible to go against national regulations, especially as professional norms have shifted without informing policy makers and patient representatives.

The aim of the survey was to explore how the new discourse affects the practice of management. The results show that entrepreneurship is a construction and a contested concept. Nevertheless, executives are very sensitive to the concept. It certainly confuses them and can make them feel more vulnerable.

While it is an important data source for health- care professionals in their everyday work, and for quality assessment by third parties, the (paper) medical record is usually negatively evaluated because of incompleteness. In this article, we show that completeness is relative to the purpose for which the record is used. We distinguish two contexts in which the trauma record is used: the primary- care process at the AED, and assessment and monitoring of trauma care. Incompleteness of the medical record is valued differently in these contexts. Especially with regard to the information demands of quality assessment, and more specifically the national trauma registry, the work processes in the AED have not evolved sufficiently as yet. Information technology has great power to improve completeness and to facilitate quality assessment, but it cannot solve the problem of incompleteness in itself. One solution we propose is to restructure the recording process by introducing a clerk. This clerk could also be a nurse or physician who is temporarily released from direct patient care.",emergency trauma care,Medical Informatics

Methods: Respondents were asked to place cards with descriptions of EQ-5D health states on a 20 cm EuroQol VAS and modified versions of it, positioning them such that the distances between the states reflect their valuation for these states. Anchor-point bias was examined using the standard EuroQol VAS (n = 212) and a modified version (n = 97) with a different lower anchor. Context bias was examined in another group of respondents (n = 112) who valued three different sets of EQ-5D health states. Marker bias was studied in yet another group of respondents (n = 100) who placed the same EQ-5D states on the standard EuroQol VAS and on a modified VAS without anchors, categories, or measurement markers. Results: No indication for the existence of the anchor-point and the marker bias was found. However, the VAS valuations were significantly affected by the context of the set of health states in the scaling task. Conclusion: Advanced methodologies should be incorporated in VAS valuation studies to deal with the context bias.",visual analogue scale,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

These professionals learned to speak each other's language, learned how other professionals and organisations work and learned to look at the care process from a network perspective instead of only from a professional or organisational perspective. Through this learning process, they also experienced the limitations of standardizing knowledge in criteria, protocols and rules, and the value of direct contact for sharing information and knowledge, to ensure continuity in care.

For Dutch health plans this implies that they need to collect data about their own performance and that of the care providers they contract. To that end, Consumer Assessment of Health Plan Surveys (CAHPS) instruments have recently been adopted by a large Dutch health plan. Objectives: This paper presents the results of a validation study of the Dutch version of the CAHPS Adult Commercial questionnaire. The questions addressed are as follows: Can this questionnaire be adapted for use in the context of the Dutch insurance system? and Can it generate valid information about the quality of health care and the performance of Dutch health plans? Methods: The translated questionnaire has been mailed to a sample of 977 enrollees. The psychometric properties of the translated instrument have been studied, and the results have been compared with those of other Dutch and American studies. Results: The net response rate was 51% (n = 500). In general, the questionnaires were filled out completely and consistently. Principal component analyses revealed a factor that can be labelled as patient-centredness in the primary process. It contains the domains that in the CAHPS literature are described as 'courteous/helpful staff' and 'doctors communicating well'. Conclusions: The translated version of the CAHPS Adult Commercial questionnaire is a promising tool for Dutch health plans.

This explosive growth is caused mainly by a few so-called 'expensive drugs' of which the oncolytics form the main part. The global budgets should stimulate more effective provision of care ('technical efficiency'), however the room for technical efficiency is decreasing. Hospitals thus have to make impossible choices, so that eventually equal access can no longer be guaranteed. If no other policies are applied, health care goals will no longer be met.

We ask whether there are differences in the verbal interaction of Dutch GPs with immigrant and Dutch patients. Data were drawn from 144 adult patient interviews and video observations of consultations between the patients and 31 Dutch GPs. The patient group consisted of 61 non-Western immigrants (Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese, Antillean, Cape Verdian) and 83 Dutch participants. Affective and instrumental aspects of verbal communication were assessed using Roter's Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). Patients' cultural background was assessed by ethnicity, language proficiency, level of education, religiosity and cultural views (in terms of being more traditional or more modern). Consultations with the non-Western immigrant patients (especially those from Turkey and Morocco) were well over 2 min shorter, and the power distance between GPs and these patients was greater when compared to the Dutch patients. Major differences in verbal interaction were observed on the affective behavior dimensions, but not on the instrumental dimensions. Doctors invested more in trying to understand the immigrant patients, while in the case of Dutch patients they showed more involvement and empathy. Dutch patients seemed to be more assertive in the medical conversation. The differences are discussed in terms of patients' ethnic background, cultural views (e.g. practicing a religion) and linguistic barriers. It is concluded that attention to cultural diversity does matter, as this leads to different medical communication patterns. A two-way strategy is recommended for improving medical communication, with implications for both doctor and patient behavior. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, this broad perspective may be in conflict with the narrower perspective of the health-care decision-makers we are usually trying to aid. In this article, it is argued that not all costs have to be considered equally important for health-care decision-making and that there is a discrepancy between the economically preferred societal perspective and the aim of aiding health-care decision-makers. This is related to the concept of local rationality. Three reasons why some costs may be considered more important for health-care decision-makers than others are: 1) relevance; 2) equity; and 3) responsibility. We suggest that it may be useful to adopt a two-perspective approach as a standard, presenting one cost-effectiveness ratio following a strict health-care perspective and one following the common societal perspective. The health-care perspective may assist the health-care policymaker better in achieving health-care goals, while the societal perspective indicates whether the local rationality of the narrow health-care perspective is also in line with societal optimality. More research on actual decisions should provide more insight into the relative weights attached to different types of costs.",perspective,Health Care Sciences & Services

One aspect of the new scheme is that the insured can choose to have a deductible. This option should increase the individual responsibility and reduce moral hazard. In the new scheme, a risk equalization system is aimed at avoiding preferred risk selection and insolvency of insurance companies with a relatively high-risk pool. A crucial issue with respect to a voluntary deductible in this type of social health insurance is whether the premium rebate should be community rated or risk rated. The Dutch government has chosen the former, which means that the premium rebate will be independent of health status and risk. Our analysis shows that, in a situation with ""accurate"" risk equalization, a community-rated premium rebate could lead to an adverse selection spiral. Over time, this spiral results in none of the insured taking a deductible and thus no reduction in moral hazard.",,Business & Economics

However, this incorporation depends on practically applicable, reliable and valid methods to register the impact of informal care. This paper presents the conceptualisation and a first test of the CarerQol instrument, aimed at measuring care-related quality of life in informal caregivers. The instrument combines the information density of a burden instrument (encompassing seven important burden dimensions) with a valuation component (a VAS scale for happiness). The instrument was tested in a Dutch sample of heterogeneous caregivers (n = 175) approached through regional caregiver support centres. This first test describes the feasibility as well as convergent and clinical validity of the CarerQol instrument. The seven burden dimensions related well with differences in VAS scores. In all instances, the average CarerQol-VAS scores decreased as the severity of problems increased. Multivariate analyses showed that the seven burden dimensions explained 37-43% of the variation in CarerQol-VAS scores, depending on the model used. The CarerQol seems a promising new instrument to register the impact of informal caregivers in economic evaluations.",valuation,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Methods: Data from a community-based sample of adults (n=9428) were used, of whom a health survey and claims data, indicating health care use, were available. Assessments of depressive complaints and somatic illnesses were based on self-report. Binomial regression analyses were used to study the expected relations. Results: Depressive complaints and somatic morbidity were both positively related to general health care utilization. Somatic morbidity has an attenuating effect on the impact of depressive complaints: If it becomes more severe, the impact of depressive complaints on utilization is reduced. Depressive complaints are especially related to the use of paramedic services, use of prescription drugs, and consultations of medical specialists. Conclusion: Depressive complaints predict somatic health care utilization, but somatic morbidity attenuates this relation. Future research on this subject should include interaction effects of depressive complaints and somatic morbidity. Interventions aiming to reduce excess use related to mental distress should be primarily targeted on subjects with mental distress who have no comorbid somatic morbidity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We find that risk compensation schemes are the first-best intervention strategy because they guarantee an 'acceptable level of solidarity' without hindering free trade and competition and without reducing efficiency. Second-best options are premium and excess-loss compensation schemes, which guarantee solidarity at the expense of some efficiency. Premium rate restrictions and open enrolment should be avoided because they reduce efficiency and are unnecessary, not proportional, and undesirable to the pursuit of the general good. These conclusions are relevant for EU countries that adopt premium rate restrictions and open enrolment in combination with a risk compensation scheme, such as Ireland and the Netherlands. In these countries policy makers should design the health insurance schemes in conformity with EC law, for example by replacing premium rate restrictions and open enrolment with premium and/or excess-loss compensation schemes.",,Health Care Sciences & Services

Most EQ-5D health states can be ordered logically. When people assign values to different health states, they may violate this logical order, which can be seen as inconsistencies. Objective. The aim of this Study was to assess the effect of inconsistently valued EQ-5D health states on mean visual analog scale (VAS) and time trade-off (TTO) values. The authors also examined the effect of removing respondents with high numbers of inconsistent states on the estimation of tariffs, which is used to interpolate values to all possible EQ-5D states from the direct valuation of a subset of states. Method. Data from the Dutch EQ-5D valuation study were used. A representative sample of 309 Dutch adults valued 17 EQ-5D health states by VAS and TTO. A state was valued inconsistently when it had a higher value than at least 1 logically better state. Mean values of groups with various numbers of inconsistently valued states were compared. Results. Of the respondents. 65% had inconsistencies for VAS and 89% for TTO. The mean VAS values of consistent respondents tend to be lower. For TTO, those with inconsistencies gave lower values. Removing, data of respondents with the highest number of inconsistently valued states for VAS (13%) and TTO (9%) did not result in statistically significant different coefficients in the estimated tariff using all data. Conclusion. The majority of respondents valued at least 1 state inconsistently. For both VAS and TTO, the presence of these inconsistencies did not affect the estimated tariffs.",EQ-5D,Medical Informatics

The authors reviewed the literature on physician response to drug safety alerts and interpreted the results using Reason's framework of accident causation. In total, 17 papers met the inclusion criteria. Drug safety alerts are overridden by clinicians in 49% to 96% of cases. Alert overriding may often be justified and adverse drug events due to overridden alerts are not always preventable. A distinction between appropriate and useful alerts should be made. The alerting system may contain error-producing conditions like low specificity, low sensitivity, unclear information content, unnecessary workflow disruptions, and unsafe and inefficient handling. These may result in active failures of the physician, like ignoring alerts, misinterpretation, and incorrect handling. Efforts to improve patient safety by increasing correct handling of drug safety alerts should focus on the error-producing, conditions in software and organization. Studies on cognitive processes playing a role in overriding drug safety alerts are lacking.",,Medical Informatics

We developed a survey in which we asked informal caregivers in The Netherlands to indicate the different types of time forgone (paid work, unpaid work and leisure) in order to be able to provide care. Moreover, we asked informal caregivers how much time they spent on a list of 16 informal care tasks during the week before the interview. Data were obtained from surveys in two different populations: informal caregivers and their care recipients with stroke and with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A total of 218 care recipients with stroke and their primary informal caregivers completed a survey as well as 147 caregivers and their care recipients with RA. The measurement of care according to both methods is more problematic compared to the valuation. This is especially the case for the opportunity costs method and for the housework part in the proxy good method. More precise guidelines are necessary for the consistent application of both methods in order to ensure comparability of results and of economic evaluations of health care. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed a mathematical simulation model of breast cancer using the stage distribution and case fatality rates in the presence and absence of treatment as predictors of survival. Outcome measures were life-years adjusted for disability (DALYs), costs (in 2000 U.S. dollars) of treatment and follow-up, and cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs; in dollars per DALY averted). Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the robustness of the results. Treating patients with stage I breast cancer resulted in 23.41, 12.25, and 19.25 DALYs averted per patient in Africa, North America, and Asia, respectively. The corresponding average CERs compared with no intervention were $78, $1960, and $62 per DALY averted. The number of DALYs averted per patient decreased with stage; the value was lowest for stage IV treatment (0.18-0.19), with average CERs of $4986 in Africa, $70,380 in North America, and $3510 per DALY averted in Asia. An extensive breast cancer program resulted in 16.14,12.91, and 12.58 DALYs averted per patient and average CERs of $75,$915, and $75 per DALY averted. Outcomes were most sensitive to case fatality rates for untreated patients, but varying model assumptions did not change the conclusions.

Methods Data were used from a community-based sample of adults (N=9,428). Psychological distress was measured using three different instruments: the Negative Affect Scale of Bradburn, a nervousness scale, and a self-reported depressive complaints. Physical illness was measured by seven specific chronic conditions, a co-morbidity index of 17 conditions and two disability measures. Subjective health was assessed by a single question. Ordinary least square and logistic regression as well as structural equation modelling were used to analyse the data. Results The relation between subjective health and PD is strongest in case nervousness and this, or negative affect, are used as indicators of PD. The measure of depressive complaints is less strongly, but still substantially, related to subjective health. After correction for physical illness variables, the change in strength of the association is slightest for depressive complaints and highest for nervousness. Only small differences between negative affect and nervousness were established. These measures, which were more contaminated by physical ill health than depressive complaints, have the strongest association with subjective health both before as well as after correction for physical illness components. Conclusions Negative affect and nervousness are reliable and valid indicators of PD, which can be used to predict subjective health. However, for this purpose, a correction for the confounding effects of physical illness variables will be necessary. The depressive complaints measure is not only less predictive of subjective health but also less contaminated by physical illness variables, making it a better indicator of PD if correction for physical illness variables is not possible.",perceived health,Psychiatry

Setting Under the auspices of the specialty societies of surgeons, paediatricians and gynaecologists, 25 groups were offered similar to 20 h of management consulting to support the implementation of recommendations for quality improvement and were compared to 25 specialist groups not receiving the support. Intervention The Quality Consultation (QC) took a site-specific multifaceted implementation approach. Main measures Self-reported degree of implementation of recommendations, specialists' judgement of implementation result and process; experienced obstructing factors in implementing recommendations. Results The response rate was 54% (n = 110). The supported specialist groups were more successful in partially or fully implementing the recommendations from external peer assessment: 66.1% vs. 53.8%. The implementation result and process were also rated significantly higher for the supported groups. The supported groups reported significantly less (P < 0.005) obstructing factors; in particular for the barriers 'expectation of implementation advantages', 'acceptance of the recommendations' and 'assessed self-efficacy'. The experienced obstructing factors are strongly related with the degree of implementation (spearman rho 0.57-32.5%). Conclusions This study suggests QC is a powerful implementation strategy.

Focusing on effectiveness and safety, the set was developed by the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their task: monitoring the quality of the care delivered by providers. In addition, the set would enhance the transparency of the hospital sector, and stimulate individual hospitals to improve their scores. Bridging some of the classic distinctions between 'internal' and 'external' indicators, the Inspectorate's vision was to rapidly produce a feasible set of indicators that would fulfill these aims, while maximally preventing 'side effects' such as misinterpretations, defensive or perverse reactions. Explicitly avoiding the trap of searching for exhaustive validity of the indicators, the inspectorate's motto was 'feasability first'.

We set up an experiment to analyze which of these equity concepts best reflects people's distributional preferences. Sixty respondents assigned a priority rank to the treatment of 10 conditions using the paired comparison technique. We described these real-life conditions by their actual QALY profiles, i.e. in terms of age, disease free period, duration of disease, quality of life, and life years lost. Next we determined the priority rank order of the 10 conditions by the three equity concepts, using the weights that each equity concept attributes to the different units of the QALY profile describing the 10 conditions. To explore the social interpretation of equity, we compared the observed and theoretical rank orderings using Spearman correlations. All correlations were significant at a 0.05 level. Fair innings best predicted the observed rank order of the 10 conditions (r=0.95). Weaker correlations were found for proportional shortfall(r=0.82) and severity of illness (r=-0.65). This result calls attention to health policy, because actual health care decisions often reflect concerns of severity of illness. This raises the question if health care decision makers evaluate the claims of different patients for health care by appropriate criteria. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is of interest that the total mean costs of patients alive with no evidence of disease is least for the BT-group: 4615, 101 as opposed to (sic)25,288 (S) and (sic)18,674 (EBRT). Main underlying cause for the high costs with S as opposed to RT alone is the number of associated clinical admission days, not only during primary treatment, but also at relapse.

We call for a shift away from present economic evaluation activities-that tend to produce ad hoc and incomparable economic evaluation studies and, therefore, add little to the compendium of knowledge of cost-effectiveness of health interventions in general-toward a more systematic approach. Research efforts in economic evaluation should build on the foundations of cost-effectiveness research of the past decades to arrive at an informative methodology useful for national policy-makers. This strategy means that governments should steer sectoral cost-effectiveness analysis to obtain systematic and comprehensive information on the economic attractiveness of a set of new and current interventions, using a standardized methodology and capturing interactions between interventions. Without redirecting the focus of economic evaluation research, choosing in health care bears the risk to remain penny-wise but pound-foolish.",methodology,Medical Informatics

Compared to the normally recommended valuation methods, like the opportunity cost method and proxy good method, CM is probably better able to capture the heterogeneity of informal care. We developed a survey in which informal caregivers were asked to rate four different hypothetical informal caregiving situations, which differed with respect to care hours, care tasks and monetary compensation. Data were obtained from postal surveys. A total of 135 pairs of informal caregivers and care recipients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from the Netherlands returned a completed survey and were used in the analysis. Informal caregivers require an extra compensation of 1.00 euro per hour for providing one additional hour of the same informal care task (meaning that from the seventh to the eighth hour, they require 8 euro). For providing two extra hours of care, they require 2.00 euro compensation per hour. The relative valuation of informal care tasks is very diverse. Respondents require a compensation of 13.43 euro per hour for switching from providing light housework to personal care and 0.56 euro per hour for switching from providing personal care to heavy housework. Though CM is sometimes regarded as cognitively complex, 70% of the respondents were able and willing to evaluate the hypothetical caregiving scenarios. Elderly respondents especially had more difficulty with the method. In sum, CM is seen as a promising alternative for existing methods to determine a monetary value of informal care. The presented valuations of informal care can be incorporated in the numerator of a cost-effectiveness ratio in economic evaluations of health care.

This study reveals that there is no real focus of research:in CBR and therefore the evidence base for CBR is fragmented and incoherent on almost all aspects of CBR.

That is, what universal goals need to be realized by individuals in order to enhance their well-being? Social production function (SPF) theory asserts that the universal goals affection, behavioral confirmation, status, comfort and stimulation are the relevant dimensions of subjective well-being. Realization of these substantive goals and the perspective on opportunities to realize these goals in the future contributes to the affective and cognitive component of well-being. The theoretical elaboration of this theory has been published elsewhere. This paper provides a measurement instrument for the dimensions of well-being. To measure levels of affection, behavioral confirmation, status, comfort and stimulation and empirically validate the dimensions of wellbeing, the SPF-IL scale was developed. This paper presents findings from a pilot study (n = 145), the main study (n = 1094), a test-retest examination (n = 163), and a validation study (n = 725). The measurement model was tested by means of structural equation modeling. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the dimensional structure of well-being indicating construct validity. The overall fit of the model was sufficient, in spite of the somewhat problematic measurement of status, and the test-retest study showed an acceptable level of stability. As for the content validity of the dimensions and their measurement, various sub-studies showed that the SPF-IL scale is a valid instrument, doing at least as well as popular measures of overall well-being but also specifying its dimensions.",subjective well-being,Sociology

The aim of this simulation study was to investigate how standard methods for dealing with incomplete data perform when applied to cost data with various distributions and various types of dropout. Selected methods included the product-limit estimator of Lin et al. the expectation maximisation (EM-) algorithm, several types of multiple imputation (MI) and various simple methods like complete case analysis and mean imputation. Almost all methods were unbiased in the case of dropout completely at random (DCAR), but only the product-limit estimator, the EM-algorithm and the MI approaches provided adequate estimates of the standard error (SE). The best estimates of the mean and SE for dropout at random (DAR) were provided by the bootstrap EM-algorithm, MI regression and MI Monte Carlo Markov chain. These methods were able to deal with skewed cost data in combination with DAR and only became biased when costs also included the costs of expensive events. None of the methods were able to deal adequately with informative dropout. In conclusion, the EM-algorithm with bootstrap, MI regression and MI MCMC are robust to the multivariate normal assumption and are the preferred methods for the analysis of incomplete cost data when the assumption of DCAR is not justified.

Second, uncertainty surrounding costs and effects is included in the model using expected utility. Other approaches to uncertainty that do not specify a utility function are discussed and it is argued that these also include implicit notions about risk attitude.

A convenience sample of 20 health professionals had to rate a health status on a visual analogue scale (VAS) without being explicitly asked to consider the effects of ill-health on income and leisure. A majority of respondents (60%) does not consider income effects and 75% does consider the effects on leisure. Explicitly asking respondents to incorporate these effects lowers the valuation. Our results indicate that whatever separation between costs and effects is preferred, using quality of life measures which are silent on income and leisure, leads to either double-counting or ignoring real costs or effects.

The use of these quantitative relationships may increase the power to demonstrate significant effects of drugs, obviating the need to include large numbers in comparative trials. Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) hospitalized for treatment of an infectious exacerbation due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa were eligible for the study. They received tobramycin 3.3 mg/kg tid as initial therapy in combination with ticarcillin 125 mg/kg qid. Blood samples were drawn at t = 0-8 h after infusion. Pharmocokinetic parameters and PI were calculated for every individual and correlated to the relative improvement in forced expiratory volume during the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) between pretreatment and days 9-11 as a measure of efficacy. The 3 PI fAUC/MIC,fPeak/MIC, and T-> MIC of tobramycin showed a significant correlation with effect and was the highest for the fAUC/MIC relationships with FEV1 and FVC as determined both by the Emax model as well as Spearman correlations (r = 0.77, P = 0.002 and 0.58, P = 0.036 for FEV1 and FVC). Pharmacokinetic parameters AUC and Peak as such showed no significant correlation with effect, nor did the MIC values. There is a significant relationship between PI of aminoglycosides and efficacy parameter (increase in FEV1 and FVC) in patients with CF.

It addresses the common grounds and differences with other methods of presenting uncertainty to decision-makers. This comparison uses the cost-effectiveness results of medical guidelines for Dutch diabetes type 2 patients in primary and secondary care. Stochastic league tables define the optimum expansion pathway as compared to baseline, starting with the least costly and most cost-effective intervention mix. Multi-intervention cost-effectiveness acceptability curves are used as a way to represent uncertainty information on the cost-effectiveness of single interventions as compared to a single alternative. The stochastic league table for diabetes interventions shows that in case of low budgets treatment of secondary care patients is the most likely optimum choice. Current care options of diabetes complications are shown to be inefficient compared to guidelines treatment. With more resources available one may implement all guidelines and improve efficiency. The stochastic league table approach and multi-intervention cost-effectiveness acceptability curves in uncertainty analysis lead to similar results. In addition, the stochastic league table approach provides policy makers with information on affordability by budget level. It fulfils more adequately the information requirements to choose between interventions, using the efficiency criterion.

However, the use of such methods for short periods of absence is controversial. A previous study found that short-term absence is often compensated for during normal working hours and therefore does not lead to productivity losses. As such, the application of any approach almost certainly overestimates productivity costs. In this study, we examined the productivity costs for five different patient populations and one employee population, using the classical method and by identifying when extra effort was needed. In general, the results showed that productivity costs based on identifying extra effort were 25-30% of the classical estimates. For absences of just one day, productivity costs were relevant in only 17-19% of cases. For absences of two weeks or longer, productivity costs were relevant in 35-39% of cases. Measurement of the compensating mechanisms seemed to be valid, since there is considerable agreement between the opinion of supervisors and their employees about whether compensation covers productivity costs. There was much less agreement between supervisors and their employees on specific compensating mechanisms, however. The measurement of compensating mechanisms also seemed to be valid, because - as expected - different compensating mechanisms were reported for different occupations. In our study populations, compensating mechanisms appeared to differ with occupational characteristics, like part-time work, managerial work and shift work.

Mean EQ-5D scores were compared for groups of patients classified by level of productivity. The relationship between quality of life and productivity was also assessed using Spearman rank correlation coefficients. Results: Mean EQ-5D scores for patients without productivity losses were a half to a full standard deviation higher than for patients with the lowest levels of productivity. The correlation between quality of life and productivity was moderate. Conclusion: Lower levels of quality of life were associated with efficiency loss and absenteeism. However, due to the moderate strength of the relation the use of information on quality of life to model productivity costs in case of absence of productivity data was not recommended.",quality of life,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

This paper estimates the cost effectiveness of surgery and antibiotics in trachoma-endemic areas in seven world regions. Methods: A population model was applied to follow the lifelong impact on individuals receiving trachoma control. Intervention costs and effectiveness estimates were based on a combination of primary data collection and literature review. Results: Providing trichiasis surgery to 80% of those who need it would avert over 11 million DALYs per year globally, with cost effectiveness ranging from I$13 to I$78 per DALY averted across regions. Mass antibiotic treatment of all children using azythromycin at prevailing market prices would avert more than 4 million DALYs per year globally with cost-effectiveness ranging between I$9,000 and I$65,000 per DALY averted. The intervention is only cost-effective if azythromycin is donated or becomes available at reduced prices. Mass treatment of all children with tetracycline and targeted treatment with azythromycin are not cost-effective. Conclusions: As individual components of the SAFE strategy, trichiasis surgery for trachoma is a cost-effective way of restoring sight in all epidemiological sub-regions considered, as is the use of azythromycin, if donated or at reduced prices. Large study uncertainties do not change study conclusions. The results should be interpreted in the context of the overall SAFE strategy to address issues of sustainability.",cost-effectiveness,Ophthalmology

The aim of this study is to estimate the costs of renal, liver and heart transplantation in a university hospital, adopting a similar costing methodology for all the three kinds of transplantation. Resource use data were collected from 803 patients transplanted between January 1995 and August 2001. Data about the time physicians and other hospital employees spent per transplantation were based on interviews. All costs from pretransplantation screening up to 3 years post-transplantation were taken into account and divided into costs of patient care and programme-related costs. Mean cost of renal transplantation varied from Euro 70 723 for cadaveric donor transplantations to Euro 76 577 for living donor transplantations. Mean costs of liver transplantation were Euro 141 510 and the mean costs of heart transplantation were Euro 171 828. Direct costs of patient care contributed to 79%, 87% and 92% of the costs of renal, liver and heart transplantation respectively. Inpatient hospital days were the largest contributor to the costs of patient care. The mean number of inpatient hospital days from pretransplantation screening to 3 years post-transplantation varied from 46 days for renal transplantation from a living donor to 58 days for renal transplantation from cadaveric donors, 83 days for heart transplantation and 108 days for liver transplantation. In conclusion, costs of liver and heart transplantation were approximately 2.0 and 2.5 times higher than the cost of renal transplantation. Length of inpatient hospital stay for transplantation did not change substantially over time between 1995 and 2001.",renal transplantation,Transplantation

Methods: A state transition model was developed to estimate the clinical course, costs and quality of life of patients with stage II, III or IV DLBCL receiving initial treatment with CHOP or R-CHOP to arrive at the ICER. The base year for the cost analysis was 2002 and was performed from the societal perspective. Only direct medical costs were included. The time horizon of the model was 15 yr and both costs and effects were discounted at 4%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of varying base-line assumptions of the model. Results: The incremental gain in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) was 0.88 in both the younger and the older patient groups. The costs were e12 343 higher in the younger group of patients and e15 860 in the older patients. This resulted in an ICER of e13 983 for the younger and e17 933 for the older patients per QALY gained. These results were sensitive to the time horizon of the model, other variations had a marginal impact on the outcome. Conclusion: The addition of rituximab to standard therapy for DLBCL results in a gain of 0.88 QALYs.

Two main questions will be answered. First, what organizational reforms are taking place, and how widespread are these reforms? Second, what do reforms mean for the real-life workings of health care organizations, most specifically for managerial behaviour? As far as reforms are concerned, it will be concluded that organizational changes are widespread, especially strategic apex reform and mergers. To a lesser extent, organizational structures are adapted and new relations between management and professionals are developed. Organizational and managerial contexts count albeit in unexpected ways. The professional context counts: management uses organizational reform to provide counterweight vis-a-vis and control of professionals. In addition, managerial background counts, but in a limited way: executives with limited managerial careers opt for organizational reform. Finally, organizational size counts, exerting a strong influence on organizational reform. As far as behavioural consequences are concerned, it will be concluded that organizational reform goes hand-in-hand with behavioural confusion. An 'organizational pull' appears to be strong. Executives are forced to be 'down to earth' managers, while they express 'exotic' desires to be strategists and entrepreneurs. Paradoxically, most organizational reforms strengthen this pull.",organizational (re)form,Public Administration

Methods: In a Dutch cohort of 234 patients with DMT1 we assessed PHF over time with two generic instruments: RAND-36 and EuroQol. We applied multilevel modelling to estimate change in PHF over the years 1995-2001. We compared change in PHF with change estimated from a comparably aged sample from the general population using a one-sample t-test. Results: Patients reported a significant decrease in PHF for most RAND-36 subscales. Mean changes in RAND-36 scores ranged from -0.09 (mental health) to -1.18 per year (bodily pain). EQ scores decreased significantly as well. Patients in the cohort had a faster decrease in three RAND-36 subscales and EQ-VAS over time than the estimated decrease in the general population. Conclusion: This study showed that patients with DMT1 have a faster decrease in PHF over time than comparably aged persons from the general population.

We argue that these reforms can be characterized as policy learning within and between competing policy programs. Policy learning denotes the process by which policy makers and stakeholders deliberately adjust the goals, rules, and techniques of a given policy in response to past experiences and new information. We discern three distinctive periods. During the first period (1988-1994), the prevailing corporatist and etatist policy programs were seriously challenged by the proponents of a new market-oriented program. But when it came to political decision making and implementation, the market-oriented program soon lost its impetus because it was technically too complex and could not provide short-term solutions to meet the urgent need for cost containment. During the second period (1994-2000), the etatist program regained its previously dominant position. In parallel to a strengthening Of Supply and price controls. however, the government also persevered in creating the technical and institutional preconditions for regulated competition. Moreover, public discontent over waiting lists and the call for more autonomy by individual providers and insurers strengthened the alliance in favor of regulated competition. This led to the revival of the market-oriented program in a 2001 reform plan. We conclude that the odds of these new post-2001 reforms succeeding are substantially higher than in the first period due to the technical and institutional adjustments that have taken place in the past decade.",,Biomedical Social Sciences

Methods: Fifty-one patients participated in the prospective, longitudinal questionnaire study. The EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EuroQol-5D were administered 2 wk after completion of vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethason/vincristine, adriamycin and methyl prednison (VAD/VAMP) chemotherapy, both at hospital discharge after treatment with high-dose melphalan (HDM) and 1 month after this hospital discharge, at hospital admission, at the day of hospital discharge for peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) and at 6 and 12 months following discharge after PSCT. Results: Overall, patients' functioning improved during treatment and follow-up, with significant decreases shortly following PSCT. Shortly after HDM and PSCT, patients reported a considerable increase in levels of soreness in the mouth (+26/+36 points on a scale ranging form 0 to 100; P < 0.01), change of taste (+23/+21 points; P < 0.05/NS), nausea/vomiting (+26/+27 points; P < 0.01/< 0.05), appetite loss (+40/+43 points; P < 0.001) and diarrhoea (+25/+36 points; P < 0.01). However, none of these symptoms persisted during follow-up. Conclusion: The intensive treatment programme was subjectively being well tolerated by the majority of patients. The duration of declined quality of life after administration of HDM seemed to be short. The duration of subjective recovery after PSCT remained uncertain, but in any case was present at the 6 month follow-up.

The 15 studies that were restricted to service use during index admission showed mixed results: length of hospital stay was related to common mental disorders in some studies, but other studies did not find such an association.

This means, in Amartya Sen's terms, that one's health capabilities decline beyond a certain age, making it more difficult to achieve functionings such as mobility or sexual activity. In this paper, we investigate whether this normal reduction in quality of life also induces less than perfect health states to be considered acceptable at advanced stages of life. In other words, we investigate whether it is considered acceptable that health capabilities decline over time. In this study, we use domain-specific descriptions of health (mostly following the EQ-5D domains) in order to investigate whether the acceptability of less than perfect health states is similar for all types of health losses. Besides a theoretical consideration of this issue, we present some empirical evidence based on the answers of 226 respondents to a web-based survey. The results show that often individuals do indeed consider less than perfect health states acceptable, especially at more advanced stages of life. Mild health problems are more often considered acceptable than severe health problems. The acceptability of health states is related to the quality of life score of these states, i.e., worse states are considered less acceptable. This may have implications for the allocation of scarce health care resources. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",rationing,Biomedical Social Sciences

Results: Both the level of subjective burden and the condition of feeling substantially burdened were associated with both caregiver's and patient's health-related quality of life, patient's age, and the number of caregiving tasks performed. Conclusions: These conditions can be used in clinical practice to identify potentially vulnerable caregivers in need of support and at risk of adverse health effects.

Results of the simulation were analysed using a maximum likelihood approach. Results: No relevant difference was found between the designs. The crossover design resulted in slightly more pregnancies than the parallel design. Carryover effects may slightly distort the estimates of treatment effects.

Which wishes of which stakeholders should be honored? How can we legitimize the new societal and public role of business firms? The outcome of this analysis will be translated to the practice of management; how can we strengthen the social responsibility of managers? Four options will be discussed. (1) Market regulation, which binds the actions of managers. (2) Professionalization of management, which seeks for better information. (3) Moral management, which incorporates norms and values from outside the market. (4) Stakeholder management, which leaves room for the participation of stakeholders.

Explaining perceived absolute risk, patients mentioned disease-relatcd factors as well as psychological factors. Uncertainty about future disease progression was a predominant factor for all patients, even those with low and high perceptions of risk. Wheelchair dependence was perceived as a serious outcome primarily because of its possible implications, such as loss of independence. When perceptions of 2-year, 10-year and the lifetime prospect of wheelchair dependence were compared, it was found that patients discriminated in their perception of absolute risk, but less in that of seriousness.

The data are taken from the 1996 wave of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). We examine two types of utilisation (the probability of a visit and the conditional number of positive visits) for two types of medical care: general practitioner and medical specialist visits using probit, truncated Negbin and generalised Negbin models. We find little or no evidence of income-related inequity in the probability of a GP visit in these countries. Conditional upon at least one visit, there is even evidence of a somewhat pro-poor distribution. By contrast, substantial pro-rich inequity emerges in virtually every country with respect to the probability of contacting a medical specialist. Despite their lower needs for such care, wealthier and higher educated individuals appear to be much more likely to see a specialist than the less well-off. This phenomenon is universal in Europe, but stronger in countries where either private insurance cover or private practice options are offered to purchase quicker and/or preferential access. Pro-rich inequity in subsequent visits adds to this access inequity but appears more related to regional disparities in utilisation than to other factors. Despite decades of universal and fairly comprehensive coverage in European countries, utilisation patterns suggest that rich and poor are not treated equally.

Since GATA3 is prominently expressed in both the inner ear and different parts of the auditory nervous system, it is not clear whether the deafness in HDR patients is caused by peripheral and/or central deficits. Therefore, we have created and examined heterozygous Gata3 knockout mice. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds of alert heterozygous Gata3 mice, analyzed from 1 to 19 months of age, showed a hearing loss of 30 dB compared to wild-type littermates. Neither physiological nor morphological abnormalities were found in the brainstem, cerebral cortex, the outer or the middle ear. In contrast, cochleae of heterozygous Gata3 mice showed significant progressive morphological degeneration starting with the outer hair cells (OHCs) at the apex and ultimately affecting all hair cells and supporting cells in the entire cochlea. Together, these Findings indicate that hearing loss following Gata3 haploinsufficiency is peripheral in origin and that this defect is detectable from early postnatal development and maintains through adulthood.

There is substantial agreement that the success of implementing information systems is determined by organizational factors. However, it is less clear what these factors are. The authors propose to characterize the introduction of an information system as a process of mutual shaping. As a result, both the technology and the practice supported by the technology are transformed, and specific technical and social outcomes gradually emerge. The authors suggest that insights from social studies of science and technology can help to understand an implementation process. Focusing on three theoretical aspects, the authors argue first that the implementation process should be understood as a thoroughly social process in which both technology and practice are transformed. Second, following Orlikowski's concept of ""emergent change,"" they suggest that implementing a system is, by its very nature, unpredictable. Third, they argue that success and failure are not dichotomous and static categories, but socially negotiated judgments. Using these insights, the authors have analyzed the implementation of a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system in a large Dutch university medical center. During the course of this study, the full implementation of CPOE was halted, but the aborted implementation exposed issues on which the authors did not initially focus.",,Medical Informatics

Two phases are distinguished, the negotiating phase, and the decision-making phase. During the first phase the agent's primary goal is to influence the policy position of other agents, whereas during the second phase the agent's goal is to find a solution (especially if there is a credible threat of a worse outcome). Convincing others is easier in a bilateral setting than in a multilateral one, and thus the decision-making phase is expected to result in an increase in multilateral interactions. To reveal the participation pattern of agents, we discuss methods for quantitative analyses of complex negotiations. A dynamic analysis of participation in multilateral negotiations gives insight into the continuity and change of participation during a negotiating process. The process of determining prices for specialized medical. care in The Netherlands is used as a case study. The quantitative methods seem to be useful for analyzing such a complex case. Following our hypothesis, in the case study multilateral contacts are, shown to be more frequent over time as compared to bilateral negotiations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Cost effectiveness studies and guidelines based on such studies are often seen as impartial, neutral instruments which try to reduce the influence of non-scientific factors. However, such rationalising instruments often hide normative assumptions about the goals of treatment, the selection of treatments, the role of the patient, and the just distribution of scarce resources. These issues are dealt with in the context of increased control over clinical practice by third parties. In particular, health insurers have a great interest in economic evidence in clinical care settings in order to control access to and quality of ( mental) health care. The authors conclude that guideline setting and cost effectiveness analysis may be seen as important instruments for making choices in health care, including mental health care, but that such an approach should always go hand in hand with a social and political debate about the goals of medicine and ( mental) health care.

A systematic literature review was carried out using MEDLINE 1966 - 2003 and EMBASE 1980 - 2003, supplemented by correspondence with expert informants, and citations from references. Five studies were identified. There were important differences between studies in terms of age and sex of samples, definition of ethnic minority children and methods of evaluating BP. Three studies of children of African descent reported lower mean SBP in boys from African descent compared to white boys, the differences being significant only in one study. In African descent girls, the mean SBP was significantly lower in one study, while DBP was significantly higher in one study. Four studies included children of South Asian origin. The Health Survey for England '99 reported on South Asian groups separately. Pakistani boys had a significantly higher age- and height-standardised mean SBP than the general population. The mean DBP was significantly higher in Indian and Pakistani boys than the general population. Pakistani and Bangladeshi girls had a significantly higher mean DBP than the general population. The other three studies, which combined South Asian subgroups found no significant differences in the mean BP between South Asians and white subjects. One study included children of Chinese descent and reported significantly higher mean DBP in Chinese boys and girls compared to the general population. Overall, BP across ethnic groups was similar.

We performed a new test of QALYs, which is valid under expected utility and under the two most influential non-expected utility theories, rank-dependent utility and prospect theory, and found considerable support for the QALY model.

In the acute phase after stroke - at stroke onset and during rehabilitation - many patients are physically or mentally not able to (self-) report their quality of life. Missing values may obviously bias cost-effectiveness results. We have examined the direct relationship between a conventional clinical scale of functional status that is suited for proxy-assessment (Barthel Index (BI)) and a measure of health related quality of life (EuroQoL-5D). Based on data collected within the framework of an evaluation of three stroke-service experiments in the Netherlands (n = 598, 6 month follow-up), we established a plausible and significant relationship between the measures. Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is) 0.25 for patients with a BI of 0, and with each additional point HRQoL increases with 0.05.

While the standard practice in economic evaluation is to discount costs and effects alike with a 3-5% discount rate, many have raised questions about this practice. The debate sometimes seems trapped in Weinstein and Stason's consistency argument. In this paper, we use a set of health care programs-resembling Weinstein and Stason's hypothetical programs-to test whether appointed societal decision makers are consistent in their preferences over present and future costs and health effects, and whether they discount costs and effects at the same rate. Our results demonstrate these appointed decision makers to be fairly inconsistent on both issues, susceptible to the framing of problems and in part myopic. In other words, our respondents appear to be incapable of providing reasonable and consistent preferences between present and future costs, and health effects for use in economic evaluations. There is some support for the idea that rather than using constant and identical rates for costs and effects, real differences in health endowment over time (the growth rate for health) could serve as a basis for discount rates.

The rank-dependent QALY model permits the formalization of influential concepts of equity in the allocation of health care, such as the fair innings approach, and it includes as special cases many of the social welfare functions that have been proposed in the literature. An important advantage of the rank-dependent QALY model is that it offers a straightforward procedure to estimate equity weights for QALYs.

The current literature suggests summarizing uncertainty in cost-effectiveness analysis using acceptability curves or net health benefits. These approaches, however, focus only on uncertainty associated with costs and effects of the programs under consideration. In the real world, most decision-makers have to fund a portfolio of health care programs. Therefore, a more comprehensive approach would include in the analysis the uncertainty of costs and effects of all programs supported by the fixed budget. This paper extends the decision rule described by Birch and Gafni (J.

Methods: A 'deprivation score' was used to categorize neighbourhoods according to their deprivation status. Data on the process of patient care were collected by means of chart review and interviews with GPs. Cases of stroke (n=188) were retrospectively audited by an expert panel with guideline-based review criteria. To measure differences in quality of patient care between neighbourhoods, deprivation scores were related to scores for sub-optimal care. Results: After adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics, patients in deprived neighbourhoods had an increased risk (OR 1.95 (95% Cl: 0.98-3.90)) of having received sub-optimal preventive care if compared with patients in non-deprived neighbourhoods. This excess risk was limited to women (OR 3.57 (95% Cl: 1.39-9.16) vs OR 1.01 (95% Cl: 0.41-2.48) in men). Adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics and risk factor distribution did not change the OR for women to receive sub-optimal care significantly (OR 3.21 (95% Cl: 1.24-8.31)). Sub-optimal care originated mainly from deficiencies in follow-up of treated hypertensive and diabetes patients and evaluation of patients' cardiovascular risk profile. Among treated hypertensive women in deprived neighbourhoods who received sub-optimal care, the mean number of deficiencies related to follow-up was almost double that of the corresponding group in non-deprived neighbourhoods. Conclusion: Quality of care to prevent stroke in general practice differs considerably between deprived and non-deprived neighbourhoods. Patients in deprived neighbourhoods, and women in particular, have almost twice the risk of receiving sub-optimal preventive care.",social deprivation,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

We develop indices for 'catastrophe' that capture the intensity of catastrophe as well as its incidence and also allow the analyst to capture the degree to which catastrophic payments occur disproportionately among poor households. Measures of poverty impact capturing both intensity and incidence are also developed. The arguments and methods are empirically illustrated with data on out-of-pocket payments from Vietnam in 1993 and 1998. This is not an uninteresting application given that 80% of health spending in that country was paid out-of-pocket in 1998. We find that the incidence and intensity of 'catastrophic' payments - both in terms of pre-payment income as well as ability to pay - were reduced between 1993 and 1998, and that both incidence and intensity of 'catastrophe' became less concentrated among the poor. We also find that the incidence and intensity of the poverty impact of out-of-pocket payments diminished over the period in question. Finally, we find that the poverty impact of out-of-pocket payments is primarily due to poor people becoming even poorer rather than the non-poor being made poor, and that it was not expenses associated with inpatient care that increased poverty but rather non-hospital expenditures.

The first question is whether there is an effect of an individual's self-assessed health (SAH) on his subsequent survival probability and if this effect differs by socioeconomic factors. Our results indicate that the effect of SAH on mortality risk declines with age-probably because of adjustment towards 'milder' overall health evaluations at higher ages-but does not seem to differ by indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) like income or education. This finding suggests that there is no systematic adjustment of SAH by SES and therefore that any measured income-related inequality in SAH is unlikely to be biased by reporting error. The second question is: how much of the income-related inequality in mortality can be explained by income-related inequality in SAH? Using a decomposition method, we find that inequality in SAH accounts for only about 10% of mortality inequality if interactions are not allowed for, but its contribution is increased to about 28% if account is taken of the reporting tendencies by age. In other words, omitting the interaction between age and SAH leads to a substantial underestimation of the partial contribution of SAH inequality by income. These results suggest that the often observed inequalities in SAH by income do have predictive power for the-less often observed-inequalities in survival by income. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The effect of comorbidities on treatment decisions depends primarily on the way in which the patient's attitude to health status risks varies with duration.

One assumption of this decision rule is complete divisibility of health care programs. In this article, we argue that health care programs cannot be completely divisible since individuals are not divisible. Consequently, instead of a linear programming approach, an integer programming approach to budget allocation is suggested. The integer programming framework can be extended to include uncertainty in the analysis. An objective function (expected aggregate effects) is maximised subject to the constraint that the probability of exceeding the budget is limited to an arbitrary level (e.g., 0.05). In case the budget is exceeded, the objective function is penalised in order to account for the opportunity costs of the additional resource requirements. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

While costs are calculated specifically for the patient group under study, effects are normally derived from preferences in the general public. The characteristics of these two groups in terms of (the opportunity of) spending time on activities need not coincide.

The rationale of this arrangement is to stimulate the sickness funds to improve efficiency in health care production and to respond to consumers' preferences. To achieve solidarity, all five countries have implemented a system of risk-adjusted premium subsidies (or risk equalization across risk groups), along with strict regulation of the consumers' direct premium contribution to their sickness fund. In this article we present a conceptual framework for understanding risk adjustment and comparing the systems in the five countries. We conclude that in the case of imperfect risk adjustment-as is the case in all five countries in the year 2001-the sickness funds have financial incentives for risk selection, which may threaten solidarity, efficiency, quality of care and consumer satisfaction. We expect that without substantial improvements in the risk adjustment formulae, risk selection will increase in all five countries. The issue is particularly serious in Germany and Switzerland. We strongly recommend therefore that policy makers in the five countries give top priority to the improvement of the system of risk adjustment. That would enhance solidarity, cost-control, efficiency and client satisfaction in a system of competing, risk-bearing sickness funds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Sometimes, however, application of these instruments is not possible, or the responsiveness is doubted. An alternative strategy is to attribute utility scores to health states of a condition-specific outcomes measure (CSOM). We explored the validity and feasibility of this strategy. Research design: Our samples determined utility scores for the health states of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) using time tradeoff (TTO). To reduce costs and time, the general population (n = 169) was interviewed in groups. We tested the validity of the group sessions in students. To test the extent of agreement between values obtained using the group and those obtained through individual administration, 63 students were interviewed individually and 54 in groups. Results: The utility scores for the disease-specific health states showed good construct validity. Also, the criterion validity of the adapted TTO was confirmed. Discussion: Disease-specific utility scores can be used in QALY analysis by converting them to a generic scale. Efforts should be undertaken to prevent response spreading. Administrating TTO in groups could reduce the time and costs of TTO administration and render the strategy of determining utilities for condition-specific health states more feasible.",utilities,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

The (cost-)effectiveness of both strategies was studied to highlight,their benefits for patients and care providers. Methods: A computer analysis was developed, following the progression of DRP and the effectiveness of metabolic control and ophthalmological care continuously and individually in cohorts of type I and type II DM patients with divergent degrees of compliance. Costs relate to present medical charges in the Netherlands. Results: Intensive glycemic control shortens the duration of blindness in a type I DM patient by 0.76 years, intensive ophthalmological care by 0.53 years. One year sight gain may cost 1126 Euros by providing ophthalmological care and 50 479 Euros by glycemic control. The duration of blindness drops in a type II DM patient by 0.48 and 0.13 years, respectively, whereas the effectiveness decreases as the age of onset of DM rises. Conclusions: The vast majority of diabetic patients benefits from both intensive glycemic control and intensive ophthalmological care, but these cost-effective interventions which are not only complementary, but also substitute each other, require lasting, full compliance by all parties concerned.

How will these technologies come into being? Within informatics, it is often stated that to informate something, we should first model it. This paper queries whether a detailed modeling of work processes and data flows is the primary step that needs to be completed before such EPRs can be developed or tailored. Building upon a sociotechnical understanding of ICT development, we argue for a reinterpretation of 'models' in such development processes. We do so through a reverse engineering of parts of the paper-based medical record, which has received little attention in medical informatics. In process-oriented EPR design, we argue, modeling should not be conceived as the crucial first step in this design, but rather as an intervention in the organizational change-processes that constitute proper ICT development.

Waiting lists and cross-border care in the Netherlands,"The recent ruling of the European Court of Justice in the case Smits-Peerbooms explicitly mentions undue delay as a legitimisation for cross-border care within the EU. In the Netherlands, waiting times are well above the norm set by several health care parties as well as maximally acceptable waiting times elicited in patients. This might indicate that Dutch patients are often entitled to care in other Member States, in the sense that insurers cannot withhold reimbursement of cross-border care in the present situation. However,,experiments clearly demonstrate that few Dutch patients are willing to travel abroad. Patients seem to prefer longer waiting in the Netherlands over shorter waiting by going abroad, even those living in border regions. In addition, mobility of patients within the Netherlands is very modest. Given this inertia in patient mobility, in the short run, cross-border care will probably remain an insignificant phenomenon in terms of quantities of patients travelling abroad and therefore the impact of the Smits-Peerbooms rulings is limited.

League tables that rank alternative healthcare interventions based on their incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are seen by economists as a valuable tool to inform decision makers about the allocation of scarce healthcare resources. However, league tables frequently compare ICERs from studies that have computed these ratios using different methods and assumptions including choice of comparator, choice of discount rate, time horizon, and population subgroup. The methodological differences among studies may influence the ranking of the studies and therefore decisions made using the league table. In addition, league tables generally do not include measures of the uncertainty of the cost-effectiveness estimates. In this paper, a reference case approach is proposed for the computation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and an expanded set of measures is proposed for inclusion in the league table.

It compares alternative procedures to impose cardinality on the ordinal responses. These include OLS, ordered probit and interval regression approaches. The cardinal measures of health are used to compute and to decompose concentration indices for income-related inequality in health. These results are validated by comparison with the individual variation in the 'benchmark' HUI responses obtained from the Canadian 'National Population Health Survey 1994-1995'. The interval regression approach, which exploits a mapping from the empirical distribution function (EDF) of HUI into SAH, outperforms the other approaches. In addition, we show how the method can be extended to allow for differences in SAH thresholds across different groups of people and to measuring and decomposing 'pure' health inequality.

Needs assessors assess, among other things, the eligibility of clients requesting admission to a residential home. According to guidelines, needs assessors should do this objectively and independently from care providers and health care insurers. The present paper examines how needs assessors explore the clients' expressed needs, determine their normative needs and advise on allocation. Needs assessors perform these tasks in a situation where a clear professional framework is absent, and moreover, residential home capacity is limited. A qualitative study was undertaken, observing 13 house calls of clients requesting admission to a residential home. Furthermore, interviews were held with all needs assessors and a document analysis was made. It was found that needs assessors use comparable methods in exploring the clients' motivation and assessing their needs in the relevant areas, apparently using a professional framework. However, when transforming the needs of clients into an adequate allocation, needs assessors struggled with interpretation of criteria and included their personal ideas of services into the allocation decision. The paper concludes with the suggestion that further professionalisation may lead to a greater uniformity in needs assessment practice, and will assist needs assessors in the difficult task of transforming clients' needs into long-term care allocation advice.",professionalisation,Social Work

Given the scarcity of cost analyses of first-line chemotherapy for NHL, it is difficult to assess the economic impact of upcoming new treatment modalities. Therefore we performed an analysis on costs of diagnosis and treatment of patients with newly diagnosed NHL who were treated with standard CHOP (-like) chemotherapy. As many NHL patients are treated in trials and the economic effects of the trial participation are unknown, our analysis included both patients treated according to trial protocols and patients treated according to standard local practice (SLP). The cost analysis was based on the total medical consumption of the patients. It was found that costs of the trial and SLP groups are within comparable ranges, although costs of diagnostic tests were somewhat higher within the trials. In elderly patients, SLP chemotherapy was discontinued more frequently in case of leucocytopenia or thrombocytopenia. This analysis provides basic information about the costs of first-line standard chemotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed aggressive NHL and the plausible ranges in which these costs may vary. Given the results, we will initiate larger studies to investigate whether trial treatments (showing more or less similar costs as SLP treatments) are more cost-effective for patients with aggressive NHL.",economics,Hematology

European health care reforms are aimed at making resource allocation in health care more efficient and more responsive to consumers' demands and preferences. These reforms in Europe have been continuing without appearing to have influenced the developments in the Caribbean very much, except in Martinique. In Trinidad and Tobago current reform entails delegation of responsibility for providing services to four regional health authorities and no purchaser/provider split at the regional or facility level as in the UK has been implemented. In the Bahamas, managed care arrangements are likely to emerge given the proximity of the United States. Recent universal coverage reform in Martinique was aimed at harmonisation of finance by bringing social security and social aid functions together under one management structure and may provide more opportunities for contracting and other initiatives towards greater efficiency. The first priority in Suriname is to restore proper functioning of the current system. Reforms in the four Caribbean territories have a largely administrative character and affect the organisation of the third party role in health care rather than fundamentally changing the relationship between this third party and the various other parties in health care.

No recent cost analysis with a proper follow-up period and donor identification expenses is available on related or voluntary matched unrelated donor (MUD) SCT for adult AML or ALL. Therefore, we calculated direct medical (hospital) costs based on 97 adults who underwent HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), and patients who received a graft from a MUD between 1994 and 1999.

The majority of these costs was generated during the hospitalisation for graft infusion. For MUD transplants, nearly one-third of these costs was spent on the search for a suitable donor.

The common explanation, which is based on expected utility, is that the disparity is caused by curvature of the utility function for duration. This explanation is, however, incomplete. People violate expected utility and these violations lead to biases in SG and TTO utilities. The paper analyzes the impact on SG and TTO utilities of three main reasons why people violate expected utility: probability weighting, loss aversion, and scale compatibility. In the SG, the combined effect of utility curvature, probability weighting, loss aversion, and scale compatibility is an upward bias. In the TTO these factors lead both to upward and to downward biases. This analysis can also explain the tentative empirical finding that the TTO better describes people's preferences for health than the SG.

The paper extends previous research by studying loss aversion and scale compatibility simultaneously and in a quantitative manner, by looking at a new decision domain, medical decision making, and by using an experimental design that is less conducive to violations of procedure invariance. We find significant evidence both of loss aversion and of scale compatibility. The effects of loss aversion and scale compatibility are not constant but vary over trade-offs and most participants do not behave consistently according to loss aversion or scale compatibility. In particular, the effect of loss aversion in medical trade-offs decreases with life duration. The rejection of constant loss aversion and constant scale compatibility is discouraging for attempts to model loss aversion and scale compatibility. The findings are encouraging for utility measurement and prescriptive decision analysis that seeks to avoid the effects of loss aversion and scale compatibility. The data suggest that there exist decision contexts in which the effects of loss aversion and scale compatibility can be minimized and that utilities can be measured that are unaffected by their impact.

Although many change-related aspects are vital, training and communication, in particular, seemed to be underestimated. Outcomes are a positive correlation between participation in quality activities and work satisfaction and a repeatedly favourable EFQM-score (compared to national levels).

However, the ""theory of use"" behind telemedicine-its rationale and the manner in which clinicians are expected to use it in their daily activities-has been only marginally investigated. In this paper we present the results of a qualitative study which examines the theory of use behind teleconsultation from the viewpoint of physicians (n = 37) in six specialities, practising in Quebec (Canada) hospitals. We employ Giddens' Structuration Theory (1984) to analyse the views, communications needs and referral strategies of physicians. Two questions are explored: (1) To what extent can teleconsultation be integrated into the routines of diverse medical specialities? and (2) Why and how might clinicians use this technology? Our research indicates that specialities relying on either thorough physical examinations or specialised investigative techniques are unlikely to restructure their work routines to accommodate teleconsultation, which they view as limited. Specialities that primarily exploit images or numerical data tend to perceive teleconsultation as more useful, The perceived enabling properties of teleconsultation increase as a function of the distance the patient would have to travel to be seen directly by a consultant. The constraining properties are linked to the type of information transmitted, since physicians believe that only objective data can be safely consulted from a distance, whereas relying on the remote physician's interpretation of subjective information is deemed inappropriate. We thus conclude that the development of teleconsultation should be consolidated around applications whose theory of use is compatible with existing clinical routines, or offers opportunities to restructure clinical work according to the needs of providers and remote communities.

This shows that in funding discussions, cost-effectiveness information is not solely decisive. In a theoretical framework for choices in health care that was developed in The Netherlands (the Dunning report, 1991), two other criteria besides cost-effectiveness were put forward as being important for rationing decisions: 'necessary care' and 'individual responsibility'. Overlooking the Viagra discussion, many of the arguments put forward seemed to be related to these two criteria. However, a clear operationalisation of the criteria necessary care and individual responsibility is lacking, which makes it difficult to use the arguments in funding decisions. In this paper, we try to demonstrate how these criteria were presented in the Viagra discussion and we will indicate how these criteria can be operationalised in relation to the outcomes of a cost-effectiveness analysis.

After critically examining the very notions of 'success' and 'failure', and after discussing the problematic nature of lists of 'critical success- or failure factors', this paper discusses three myths that often hamper implementation processes. Alternative insights are presented, and illustrated with concrete examples. First of all, the implementation of a PCIS is a process of mutual transformation; the organization and the technology transform each other during the implementation process. When this is foreseen, PCIS implementations can be intended strategically to help transform the organization. Second, such a process can only get off the ground when properly supported by both central management and future users. A top down framework for the implementation is crucial to turn user-input into a coherent steering force, creating a solid basis for organizational transformation. Finally, the management of IS implementation processes is a careful balancing act between initiating organizational change, and drawing upon IS as a change agent, without attempting to pre-specify and control this process. Accepting, and even drawing upon, this inevitable uncertainty might be the hardest lesson to learn. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. Ail rights reserved.",implementation,Medical Informatics

The aim was to investigate whether the information system would be able to improve the quality of care, as indicated by an improvement in the effectiveness and efficiency of care, and in an increase in patient satisfaction. In the pilot evaluation, we used qualitative research methods, exploring the impact of the information system on children and their parents, with the aim to find suitable indicators for a potential further, quantitative study. Yet we found that the system was little used and had marginal effects on the quality of care for children with amblyopia and their parents. It appeared that the main problem underlying this patient information system was that the needs of those people who actually would be using the system had never really been investigated. The designers had built their assumptions about these needs into the system. These appeared to be mistaken at so many levels that the system could not become a success. As a result of this pilot evaluation, the patient information project was thoroughly transformed. This study makes clear that a thorough exploration of user needs before building the system, using qualitative research methods, may be crucial because it can prevent mismatches and maximizes the chance that the eventual information system meets its most important aim: to enhance patient empowerment and improve the quality of care.

Quality of life was measured by the EuroQol, the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) and the SF-36. Patients were randomised according to a 2:1 ratio to undergo either PBSCT or ABMT. 62 patients underwent PBSCT and 29 ABMT. Costs of the transplantation period were significantly lower in the PBSCT group (15 008 Euros) than in the ABMT group (19 000 Euros). Significant differences in quality of life were all in favour of PBSCT and emerged using the RSCL, both on 14 days after the transplantation and three months after discharge. We conclude that PBSCT is associated with lower costs and a better quality of life than ABMT for patients with refractory or relapsed NHL or MH. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Prevalent and incident cases with AD came from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study of persons aged 55 years and older, including those living in institutions. Rate of cognitive decline, as measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE score), was predicted by a random effects model. Risk of institutionalization and death were estimated with polytomous logistic regression analysis. At baseline, 306 subjects were diagnosed with prevalent AD and had complete data on living conditions and cognitive function, After a mean follow-up of 2.1 years, 95 subjects with incident AD had been diagnosed. Prevalent patients showed a slower decline in cognitive function than incident patients (p = 0.004). For prevalent and incident AD patients, high age and low cognitive performance were the strongest predictors for institutionalization and death. These prognostic risk functions can provide information on the decline of Alzheimer patients and might be used to better evaluate the effect of treatments for AD. Copyright (C) 2001 S.

Relapsing progressive lymphoma patients (n = 204; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma n = 166; Hodgkin's disease n = 38) were, after induction treatment with the DHAP-VIM (cisplatin, cytarabine, dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, methotrexate) regimen, randomly (2:1) assigned to the harvest of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-mobilized stem cells after the second DHAP course or autologous bone marrow cells before the second DHAP course. These stem cells were reinfused following high-dose myeloblative chemotherapy. After induction, 118 patients obtained a partial or complete response and were eligible for randomization. In the PSCT arm (n = 76) significantly faster engraftment of neutrophils [greater than or equal to 0.1 and; greater than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l: 10.7 d (7-36, median, range), 15 (9-45) versus 13 (8-25) and 26 (14-80), P < 0.01] and thrombocytes [<greater than or equal to> 20 x 10(9)/l: 13 d (7-51) versus 18 (11-65), P < 0.01] were observed. In addition, significantly fewer transfusions of red blood cells [6 (0-23) versus 8 (2-24), P < 0.01] and platelets [4 (0-60) versus 8 (2-55), P = 0.01] were required in the PSCT arm.

This raises the question as to whether it is possible to develop guidelines, applicable on the national level, at an international level. In order to examine this, we compared the appropriateness criteria for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia ratings developed by two panels, one a single-nationality (Dutch) panel. the other a multinational (European) panel. The panels, both consisting of experienced urologists, used a modified Delphi process to rate 1152 indications for the most common treatments (surgery, alpha -blocker, finasteride and watchful waiting) on a nine-point scale. This article describes the similarities and differences between the ratings produced by the panels. The appropriateness ratings were identical for 84% of the indications (kappa = 0.76). The difference in the scores for individual indications was zero in 41% of indications and less than or equal to two in 99% of indications. This study provides strong evidence that a multinational panel can deliver essentially the same appropriateness ratings for BPH as a national panel. Developing appropriateness criteria on an international level may result in significant savings and may help contribute to the reduction of undesirable practice variation.

However, in a non-experimental real-world context, supplier-induced demand of doctors might erode some of the significant negative out-of-pocket price elasticity identified in the HIE. Belgium is an interesting test case for this hypothesis because it has relatively high rates of patient cost sharing in its public health insurance system and a very high density of physicians, all remunerated fee-for-service. We have exploited the price variation generated by a substantial increase in patient co-payment rates in 1994 to estimate out-of-pocket price elasticities for three groups of users, and for three types of services using a fixed-effects model in levels and in differences. We obtain significant out-of-pocket price elasticities for the general population in the range from - 0.39 to - 0.28 for GP home visits, - 0.16 to - 0.12 for GP office visits and - 0.10 for specialist visits. The estimates were generally lower and less significant for the groups of elderly and disabled. The differences we find in price responsiveness appear to be fairly robust and consistent with the HIE predictions. These results suggest that-at least in the short run-non-experimental utilization effects of cost sharing are very similar to the experimental evidence, even in a situation of favourable conditions for supplier-induced demand.

The project took as a starting point that explicit attention should be given to ethical and political considerations in addition to data about costs and effectiveness. In the project, two research groups set out to design guidelines and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) for two circumscribed medical areas (angina pectoris and major depression). Our third group was responsible for the normative analysis. We undertook an explorative, qualitative pilot study of the normative considerations that played a role in constructing the guidelines and CEAs, and simultaneously interviewed specialists about the normative considerations that guided their diagnostic and treatment decisions. Explicating normative considerations, we argue, is important democratically: the issues at stake should not be left to decision analysts and guideline developers to decide. Moreover, it is a necessary condition for a successful implementation of such tools: those who draw upon these tools will only accept them when they can recognize themselves in the considerations implied. Empirical normative analysis, we argue, is a crucial tool in developing guidelines for appropriate medical care.",qualitative evaluation,Biomedical Social Sciences

Risk sharing implies a reduction of an insurer's incentives for selection as well as for efficiency. In a theoretical analysis, we show how the optimal extent of risk sharing may depend on the weights the regulator assigns to these effects. Some countries employ outlier or proportional risk sharing as a supplement to demographic capitation payments. Our empirical results strongly suggest that other forms of risk sharing yield better tradeoffs between selection and efficiency. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Costs up to 1 year after LTx were Euro 107,675 (chronic liver failure) and Euro 90,792 (acute liver failure). The difference was mainly caused by higher hospitalisation costs and higher personnel costs for chronic liver failure. Medication costs for acute liver failure were higher, due to a high administration rate of expensive anti-HBs immunoglobulin therapy in patients with viral hepatitis B. LTx for chronic liver failure is more costly and seems to be more cost-effective than LTx for acute liver failure, since 1-year survival is higher in patients who underwent transplantation for chronic liver failure.",chronic liver failure,Transplantation

A randomized clinical trial to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of positron emission tomography,"Non-small cell lung cancer can be cured if the patient is medically operable and the tumor resectable. Current diagnostic strategies are aimed to detect tumor deposits that preclude resection with curative intent. However, these strategies are rather inefficient, resulting in a large number of futile invasive procedures. In the early 1990s positron emission tomography (PET) showed promising results at its introduction in the clinic, especially in oncology. A large number of accuracy studies have reported that PET is superior to conventional imaging. However, whether PET ultimately improves patient outcome should ideally be assessed by means of a randomized controlled trial. No such design has been applied to evaluate PET in oncology so far. The PLUS study was designed to compare the current strategy of conventional methods with a strategy where PET was added after completion of noninvasive techniques. Patients considered operable by the physician at this point were then randomly assigned to PET and further consequences or to standard procedures of mediastinoscopy or thoracotomy. Primary outcome events were futile thoracotomies. The trial randomized 188 patients from nine hospitals in 1 year. Patient enrollment has been stopped and data collection is in progress.

But after indirect standardization for need differences, there is little or no evidence of significant inequity in the delivery of health care overall, though in half of the countries, significant pro-rich inequity emerges for physician contacts. This seems to be due mainly to a higher use of medical specialist services by higher-income groups and a higher use of GP care among lower-income groups.

Although it is not life threatening, it has a major impact on a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQL) and overall response to chemotherapy. New antiemetics are expensive and well-conducted comparative health economic studies are rare. The aim of the study was to review the literature in the area of chemotherapy-induced emesis in cancer patients and to offer recommendations for the inclusion of these outcomes in the design of clinical trials for new antiemetic therapies. The economic literature was reviewed based on methodological standards for economic evaluation. Many studies did not comply with standards, specifically with regard to the choice of alternatives, chosen perspective, setting, type of emesis, measurement of costs and defining outcomes (including health-related quality of life). These issues are described for each study and recommendations for trial design are presented. The role of economic data is to support decision making in choosing between competing antiemetic therapies. It is the combination of clinical outcomes, costs and health-related quality of life, which will allow treating physicians to comprehensively assess the relative value of antiemetic therapies and to provide the most cost-effective therapy for their patients.

The first palliative unit in a hospital setting was the Palliative Care Unit (PCU) in the Dr Daniel den Heed Clinic, a specialized oncology hospital, now part of the Academic Hospital Rotterdam (AZR-Daniel). This PCU was designed to function as an academic laboratory, where palliative care concepts are being developed, put into practice, and evaluated. It's mission was to put the patient first in mind, heart and soul. Right from the start, special attention was paid to the implementation a system of 'care for caregivers' in order to support the staff of the PCU in caring for the terminally ill and to prevent burnout. A process evaluation has been carried out with a special focus on the effects of the implementation of the new unit on the wellbeing of the interdisciplinary team of caregivers during the first year of its existence and on the experiences with a residential training preceding the start of patient care activities and the weekly staff support meetings. In the second half of the first year, the PCU staff experienced increased levels of job-related stress. Most stress was attributed to organizational factors, related to management issues but also to lack of institutional support. Teamwork also contributed to stress within the interdisciplinary team. Direct patient care activities also had some impact on experienced stress levels, through a heavy work-load of complex care, a shortage of staff and an experienced lack of competence. While the staff support activities were designed to give emotional support and deal with death and bereavement, these issues did not arise as major problems. As a consequence, the staff support in the PCU was perhaps less successful than it could have been. However, the high stress levels of this innovative palliative team warrant attention. We discuss how support meetings could be a more effective way of caring for staff. They should be accompanied by adequate resources, a supportive management structure, and an extensive educational program. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

In this paper, we discuss the nature of 'medical information' from a sociological perspective, We focus on the (im)possibilities of the utilization of primary health care data for secondary purposes such as research and administration. In much of the literature on EPRs, this secondary utilization is only seen to depend on the question whether the IT connections are in place. It is then simply a matter of selecting which information to transport and to where. In this article, we argue that this view of medical information is mistaken. Information should be conceptualized as always entangled with the context of its production. The disentangling of information from its production context is possible, but that entails work. We propose the following 'law of medical information': the further information has to be able to circulate (i.e. the more diverse contexts it has to be usable in), the more work is required to disentangle the information from the context of its production. The question that then becomes pertinent is; who has to do this work, and who reaps the benefits? (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",nursing profession,Medical Informatics

The paper examines how Dutch policy-makers have dealt with the priority issue in health care over the past 10 years by means of a gradual incremental approach. In this approach, use is made of a mix of strategies and shared responsibilities, with an important role for the actors at the meso and the micro levels; while at the same time, the government has not abandoned the tried and trusted policy of national rationing (i.e. keeping the production capacity limited and setting a ceiling on production in order to resist the pressure on the public system of Dutch health care). Looking at the declining percentage of Gross National Product assigned to health care annually, the broad accessibility and the good overall quality of Dutch health care, it may be concluded that the issue of choice has not come off badly under this mixed approach. The degree to which the system can respond adequately to likely developments, such as a recession, worsening waiting lists, further liberalisation (i.e. the application of market forces in health care) and, by way of extension, the ongoing integration of 'Europe' is questioned.

We derive the conditions under which the lifetime utility function takes this form, both under expected utility theory and under rank-dependent utility theory, which is currently the most important nonexpected utility theory. If cost-effectiveness analysis is consistent with cost-benefit analysis, it is possible to derive tractable expressions for the willingness to pay for quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The willingness to pay for QALYs depends on wealth, remaining life expectancy, health status, and the possibilities for intertemporal substitution of consumption. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Records of 0.84 million screened women were linked to the regional cancer registries yielding a follow-up of at least 2.5 years. Age-adjusted incidence rates and relative (proportionate) incidences per tumour size including ductal carcinoma in-situ were calculated for screen-detected and interval cancers, and cancers in not (yet) screened women, comparing them with published data from the UK regions North West and East Anglia. In total 1527 interval cancers were identified: 0.95 and 0.99 per 1000 woman-years of follow-up in the 2-year interval after initial and subsequent screens respectively in the first year after initial screening interval cancers amounted to 27% (26% after subsequent screens) of underlying incidence, and in the second year to 52% (55%). Generally, interval cancers had a more favourable tumour size distribution than breast cancer in not (yet) screened women. The Dutch programme detected relatively less (favourable) invasive cancers in initial screens than the UK programme, whereas the number of interval cancers confirms UK findings.

Building upon recent sociological insights in the construction and use of information technologies for (health care) work, this paper underscores the importance of these insights for the development and evaluation of these systems. A sociotechnical approach to PCISs in health care is outlined, and two implications of this empirically grounded approach for the practices of developing and evaluating IT applications in health care practices are discussed. First, getting such technologies to work in concrete health care practices appears to be a politically textured process of organizational change, in which users have to be put at center-stage. This requires an iterative approach, in which the distinctions between 'analysis', 'design', 'implementation' and 'evaluation' blur. Second, a sociotechnical approach sheds new light on the potential roles of IT applications in health care practices. It is critical of approaches that denounce the 'messy' and 'ad hoc' nature of health care work, and that attempt to structure this work through the formal, standardized and 'rational' nature of IT systems. Optimal utilization of IT applications, it is argued, is dependent on the meticulous interrelation of the system's functioning with the skilled and pragmatically oriented work of health care professionals.

Both countries are moving towards greater financial responsibility of health insurers by means of risk-adjusted capitation payment systems. Although for the unwary observer it would appear as if both countries were following similar paths towards a common model, the authors make clear that rather different underlying rationales are driving these trends. In the Netherlands, the grand design 'Dekker proposal' for regulated competition has been replaced by a more gradual implementation of reforms with more limited scope. The ultimate goal remains a system of managed competition, albeit only for part of the health care services. In Belgium, prospective risk-adjusted capitation payment has always been at the heart of the original system in principle since its inception, but non-enforcement led to retrospective and inequitable financing in practice. Although the rhetoric of managed competition has never been used explicitly in any Belgian official government policy document, it seems unlikely that putting the insurers at financial risk without simultaneously also reinforcing their agency role by providing instruments for care management-like, for example, selective contracting-is viable in the longer run without jeopardizing the solvency of the insurers. The authors conclude that although the logic of the managed competition model is appealing, the lack of conclusive empirical evidence of success elsewhere makes governments reluctant to surrender their traditional cost containment tools. But making insurers financially accountable without simultaneously providing them with tools to take on the accountability seems useless and illogical. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

This paper presents results on the income redistribution consequences of the health care financing mixes adopted in twelve OECD countries by decomposing the overall income redistributive effect into a progressivity, horizontal inequity and reranking component. The general finding of this study is that the vertical effect is much more important than horizontal inequity and reranking in determining the overall redistributive effect but that their relative importance varies by source of payment. Public finance sources tend to have small positive redistributive effects and less differential treatment while private financing sources generally have (larger) negative redistributive effects which are to a substantial degree caused by differential treatment.

They represent new possibilities for ill employees who have to wait for medical treatments on waiting lists. Earlier proposals to allow employers in close co-operation with health insurers to start initiatives for special clinics for employees have been confronted with all kind of arguments which were considered to form serious obstacles, from theoretical, legal and economic perspectives. The European Court of Justice plays a decisive role in deciding whether free establishment and access is approved according to the rules of the EC Treaty. Private clinics can be legally allowed in the interests of the common good. However, priority treatment of a person can only be justified if the intended purpose is justified and if the priority treatment is suited as a means to (partly) realise this purpose. Furthermore, possible negative consequences may not be unreasonable in the light of-the intended consequences. In this article it will be argued that both from an economic and from a legal perspective, based on national and European law, the introduction of special clinics for employees could be allowed. The main argument is that they could be introduced on a just and equitable basis. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",waiting lists,Health Care Sciences & Services

Cost effectiveness is expressed in terms of costs per additional day of survival and costs per additional patient without any severe adverse event. The clinical results did not show significant survival differences implying great uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of raltitrexed in terms of additional costs per additional life-year gained. However, 80% of the initially higher cost of raltitrexed ($3132 per patient) is compensated by savings due to a more convenient administration scheme leading to a net cost of $626 per patient treated.

RACPs based on demographic variables only are insufficient, because they leave ample room for cream skimming. However, the implementation of improved RACPs does not al,pear to be straightforward. A solution might be to supplement imperfect RACPs with a form of mandatory pooling that reduces the incentives for cream skimming. In a previous paper it was concluded that high-risk pooling (HRP), is a promising supplement to RACPs. The purpose of this paper is to compare HRP with two other main variants of mandatory pooling. These variants are called excess-of-loss (EOL) and proportional pooling (PP). Each variant includes ex post compensations to insurers for some members which depend to various degrees on actually incurred costs. Therefore, these pooling variants reduce the incentives for cream skimming which are inherent in imperfect RACPs, but they also reduce the incentives for efficiency and cost containment. As a rough measure of the latter incentives we use the percentage of total costs for which an insurer is at risk. This paper analyzes which of the three main pooling variants yields the greatest reduction of incentives for cream skimming given such a percentage. The results show that HRP is the most effective of the three pooling variants. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",mandatory pooling,Biomedical Social Sciences

A common element of these reforms is that the consumers may choose among competing health insurers or health plans, which are largely financed through premium-replacing capitation payments. Since 1993, Dutch sickness funds receive risk-adjusted capitation payments based on demographic factors. It has been shown that the predictive accuracy of a demographic capitation model improves when it is extended with diagnostic information from prior hospitalizations, in the form of Diagnostic Costs Groups (DCGs). In this study a DCG classification is developed using Dutch cost data of sickness fund members of all ages. The study also dealt with the question of how to handle high discretion diagnoses. For the Dutch situation high discretion diagnoses may be defined as those diagnoses for which day case treatment is a possible alternative for a hospital admission. Grouping persons with a hospital admission for high discretion diagnoses together with people without an admission resulted in a slight reduction of the predictive accuracy of the DCG model. Adequate risk-adjustment is critical to the success of market-oriented health care reforms. The use of diagnostic information from prior hospitalizations seems a promising option for improving the capitation formula. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Empirical data on costs of treatment modalities and quality of life of patients were gathered alongside a clinical trial and combined with data on patient and technique survival from the Dutch Renal Replacement Registry. A Markov-chain model, based on the actual Dutch ESRD program as of January 1st 1997, predicted the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of dialysis and transplantation over the 5-year period 1997-2001. Total annual costs amounted to DFL 650 million (1.1% of the health care budget). Centre Haemodialysis was found to be the least cost-effective treatment, while transplantation and Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) were the most cost-effective treatments. The Markov-chain model was used to study the influence of substitutive policies on the overall cost-effectiveness of the ESRD treatment program. The influence of such policies was found to be modest in the Dutch context, where a high percentage of patients is already being treated with mon cost-effective treatment modalities. In countries where Centre Haemodialysis is still the only or the major treatment option for ESRD patients, substitutive policies might have a more substantial impact on cost-effectiveness of ESRD treatment.

National health policy concerns decision-making on which technologies may enter the health care market, which health care services are included in the package of health care benefits and under what conditions, and what the geographical distribution of medical services and facilities should be. Regarding the latter two issues in particular, the actual and potential role of economic evaluation in health policy is discussed. From the Dutch experience we can learn that a close cooperation between researchers and policy-makers helps to enlarge the impact of economic appraisal on policy-making and that incorporation of the right (financial) incentives is vital to the use of economic appraisal in health care decision-making.

This risk has stimulated a number of adaptive strategies to achieve organizational success. This paper presents a model of six forms of contracting relationships and reviews the adaptation strategies observed in three health systems: the USA, England and the Netherlands. These strategies include service diversification, improved management information systems, the employment of marketing and contract managers, the use of clinical pathways, case management and concurrent/retrospective review of hospital stays, quality management and quality assurance programs, pre-admission authorization, discharge planning, and physician profiling and participation in management. These adaptive strategies have three implications for managers: increased 'partnering' with purchasers, collaboration with medical staff, and assumption of managed care roles. Two groups of institutions are at risk from the changes in hospital contracting: university teaching hospitals and inner-city hospitals serving socially deprived populations. The paper ends with implications for the education of hospital managers and research on hospital management and adaption to contracting.

A crucial issue is whether or not the benefits package offered by competing insurers should also cover catastrophic risks (like several forms of expensive long-term care) in addition to non-catastrophic risks (like hospital care and physician services). In 1988 the Dutch government proposed compulsory national health insurance based on regulated competition among insurers as well as among providers of care. The competing insurers should offer a benefits package covering both non-catastrophic risks and catastrophic risks. The insurers would be largely financed via risk-adjusted capitation payments. The government intended to use a capitation formula that is, besides some demographic variables, based on multi-year prior costs. This paper presents the results of an explorative empirical analysis of the possible consequences of such a capitation formula for catastrophic risks. The main conclusion is that this formula would be inadequate because it would leave ample room for cream skimming.

The purpose of these reforms is to make resource allocation in health care more efficient, more innovative and more responsive to consumers preferences while maintaining equity. At the same time, the advances in technology result in a divergence of consumers' preferences with respect to health care and urge society to (re)think about the meaning of the solidarity principle in health care. In this paper we indicate some international trends in health care reforms and explore some potential future options. From an international perspective we can observe a trend towards universal mandatory health insurance, contracts between third-party purchasers and the providers of care, competition among providers of care and a strengthening of primary care. These trends can be expected to continue. A more controversial issue is whether there should also be competition among the third-parry purchasers and whether in the long run there will occur a convergence towards some ''ideal'' model. Although regulated competition in health care can be expected to yield more value for money, it might yield both more efficiency and higher total costs. It has been argued that equity can be maintained in a competitive health care system if we interpret equity as ''equal access to cost-effective care within a reasonable period of time''. Because the effectiveness of care has to be considered in relation to the medical indication and the condition of the patient. the responsibility for cost-effective care rests primarily with the providers of care. Guidelines and protocols should be developed by the profession and sustained by financial incentives embedded in contracts. It has been argued that the third-party purchasers could start to concentrate on the contracts with the primary care physicians. Contracts with other providers could then be a natural complement to these contracts. Coordinated-care contracts between the third-party purchasers and the consumer of care could provide the consumer with monetary incentives to go to efficient providers. A consumer choice of insurance contract could give the consumer an opportunity to make important choices in health care. However, each society has to make its own choices about what care should be available to everybody independent of an individual's purchasing power.

Firstly, to enumerate relevant aspects for chronic diseases, open interviews and a concept mapping were conducted among patients with a chronic disease, and medical specialists treating them. Here, the respondents have been asked to evaluate statements in relation to the quality of care. Secondly, a final questionnaire, including statements on nine relevant aspects of care, was presented to patients and medical specialists. The response rate among patients was 96% (N = 260) and among medical specialists 67% (N = 340). Both study populations ranked 'effectiveness of care' the highest. However, the difference in opinion between the two populations was significant, mainly due to the patient's giving a higher ranking to 'continuity of care' and a lower ranking to 'efficiency'. Significant differences were also found between the three patient groups on the aspects 'knowledge' and 'waiting time for treatment'. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis ranked 'knowledge' higher and 'waiting time for treatment' lower than did the other two patient groups. A lower level of education, having state-regulated health insurance and being older were associated with a higher preference for 'continuity'. Between the three groups of the medical specialists, no significant differences were found regarding to the profession, age and sex. In conclusion: the patients and medical specialists researched did not show wide differences of opinion on preferences of care in relation to quality. The only exception to this concerned 'continuity of care' which was ranked higher by patients.",patients with chronic diseases,Biomedical Social Sciences

In this article, recent literature is reviewed and the results of personal research are described on both the variation in care provision and on appropriateness assessment. In the few studies which have focussed on both subjects no evidence has yet been found to suggest that practice variation is to be explained by differences in appropriateness rates. However, there are still many methodological pitfalls in both variation analyses (statistical problems) and appropriateness assessment (reliability of the judgement), implying that this conclusion is far from definitive. More research should therefore be conducted on methodological questions of variation analysis and appropriateness assessment. Furthermore in variation analysis the relative contribution of all potential determinants has to be studied on the various levels of care provision. Finally, to study the relationship between practice variation and appropriateness of care, the clinical problem and not the procedure should be the starting point.",quality of care,Health Care Sciences & Services

The diagnosis of CIN I and II involves more medical procedures and time than CIN III, but fewer women have conisation or hysterectomy, resulting in lower total medical costs (Dfl 2572).

In Syrian hamsters with free-running rhythms, the onset of running-wheel activity is very precise and predictable while the end (offset) is more variable. From the thalamic intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) and the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN) a projection to the SCN originates. Animals with a lesion aimed at the IGL/vLGN and sham-and unoperated controls were kept in continuous darkness. With linear regression, lines were fitted through 10 successive onsets and offsets of activity and the mean deviation of the onsets and offsets from the fitted lines was determined. Animals with a complete or partial lesion of the IGL/vLGN had a smaller mean deviation of the circadian activity offset from the fitted regression line (0.313 h) compared with the grouped control animals (0.678 h). To test the difference statistically, we compared the sum of the square residuals of the circadian offsets between the groups. This difference was highly significant (F(69,64) = 4.16, p < 0.0001), which indicates that animals with a lesion of the IGL/vLGN have a less variable circadian offset of running-wheel activity. No differences were observed in the variability in the circadian onset of locomotor activity between experimental and control animals. It is concluded that the IGL/vLGN influence the variability of the offset of the circadian running-wheel activity.",SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS,Physiology

International comparability of these estimates may contribute to rational decision-making in health care policy. Hence, estimates should be international comparable. Comparability of these results between countries may be hampered due to variation in methodology, data sources, valuation of production losses, and social security arrangements. Furthermore differences in epidemiology, demography and economic environment may cause variation in the level and the distribution by diagnosis of indirect costs. In this study indirect costs of disease for the Netherlands are compared with estimates for Sweden and the United States. We found large differences: both in the share of indirect costs in GDP as in the constituting elements, absence from work, disability and mortality. The level of indirect costs due to absence from work and the distribution according to diagnosis are quite similar for the two European countries. The costs of disability are particularly high for the Netherlands. Comparison of disability costs between the three countries is hampered due to lack of quantitative information on the influence of social insurance arrangements on the level of indirect costs and the distribution by diagnosis. The large number of deaths at young age in the U.S. is responsible for the higher mortality costs compared to the two European countries.",HUMAN CAPITAL METHOD,Health Care Sciences & Services

We present the results of screening up to January 1, 1993, and compare these with the predicted results from the cost-effectiveness analysis, on which basis this mortality reduction had been calculated. At least 550,000 women aged 50-69 were invited to screening in 1990-1992, and 75% of these participated. Cancer was suspected from 5,162 examinations and further investigation was therefore required. Excision biopsy was done in 72% of referrals, and 2,515 breast cancers were detected. The results for 404,000 newly invited women compare favourably with expected values (in parentheses): 78% attendance rate (70%), 1.4% screen positive (1.6%), 6.8 cancers detected per 1,000 women screened (6.4) and 38% of these cancers were DCIS or invasive carcinomas smaller than I I mm in diameter (36%). More data, e.g., on treatment and interval cancers, will follow in the years to come. These first results can be interpreted as strong early signs of a reduction in breast-cancer mortality of at least the predicted size. Screening has sufficiently advanced the diagnosis, as well as or better than expected. Breast cancers diagnosed in this age group without screening are diagnosed at a worse stage than expected. Unfavourable side-effects, especially false-positive referrals, might be kept lower than those reported in other countries. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,Oncology

Four determinants of this premium reduction can be considered:  expected out-of-pocket payments, adverse selection effects, moral hazard effects, and administration costs.  The purpose of this study is to analyse the first two determinants.  Survey data of 17 242 insureds in the Netherlands have been used for this research.  Results show that the expected out-of-pocket expenditures in case of a certain deductible amount depend strongly on age and gender.  People in poor health could be given a larger premium discount if they would take a deductible than those in good health.  This implies that a uniform premium discount would induce adverse selection.  The effects of such selection have been simulated by using a survey question about the preference to take a general deductible.  If the premium reductions for policies with a deductible are adjusted for age and gender, the selection effect will halve but will still be substantial.  We conclude that, in the situation considered here, it is largely immaterial whether deductibles are compulsory or voluntary, provided premium reductions are allowed to depend on relevant risk factors.",ADVERSE SELECTION,Health Care Sciences & Services
